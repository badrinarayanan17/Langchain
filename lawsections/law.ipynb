Culpable homicide .—Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing \\ndeath, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the \\nknowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A lays  sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to \\nbe thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed th e offence of culpable \\nhomicide.  \\n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, \\ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed th e offence of c ulpable \\nhomicide.  \\n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. \\nHere, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kil l B, or to cause \\ndeath by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death.  \\nExplanation  1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, \\ndisease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shal l be d eemed to have caused \\nhis death.  \\nExplanation  2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury \\nshall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment \\nthe d eath might h ave been prevented.  \\nExplanation  3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may \\namount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought \\nforth, though the child may  not have br eathed or been completely born.  \\n300. Murder .—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by \\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or — \\n2ndly .—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be \\nlikely to cause the death of the person to whom t he harm is caused, or— \\n3rdly .—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily  injury \\nintended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or— \\n4thly .—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all \\nprobability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without \\nany excuse for incurring the risk of causing dea th or such injury as aforesaid.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in  consequence. A commits murder.  \\n(b) A, knowing that  Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention \\nof causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been \\nsufficient in the ordina ry course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is \\nlabouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound sta te of \\nhealth, here A , although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such \\nbodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature w ould cause death.  \\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword -cut or club -wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \\nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not ha ve intended to cause Z's death.  \\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them . A is guilty of murder, \\nalthough he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.  \", metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\lawsections\\\\LawSections.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"70 \\n Exception 1 .—When c ulpable homicide is not murder .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the \\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self -control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death \\nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.  \\nThe above exception is subj ect to the following provisos: — \\nFirst .—That the provocation is not sought or  voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for \\nkilling or doing harm to any person.  \\nSecondly .—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \\nservant in the lawful exercise of the  powers of such public ser vant.  \\nThirdly .—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise o f the right of \\nprivate defence.  \\nExplanation .—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from \\namounting t o murder is a question of fact . \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in \\ndoing an  act caused by the provocation.  \\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. He re A has not committed murder , but merely culpable \\nhomicide.  \\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murd er, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a publi c servant  in the exercise of his powers.  \\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has \\nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these word s, and kills Z. This is murder.  \\n(e)A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so.  \\nA is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by \\na thing done in the exercise o f the right of private defence.  \\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and  \\nto cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purp ose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only \\nculpable homic ide, but A is guilty of murder.  \\nException 2 .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the \\nright of private defence o f person or property, ex ceeds the power given to him by law and causes the \\ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and \\nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary f or the purpose of such defence.  \\nIllustration  \\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the \\nassault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has \\nnot commi tted murd er, but only culpable homicide.  \\nException 3 .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a \\npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and \\ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due \\ndischarge of his duty as such public servant and without ill -will towards the person whose death is \\ncaused.  \\nException 4 .—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is commi tted without premeditation in a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue \\nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.  \\nExplanation .—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the prov ocatio n or commits the first \\nassault.  \\nException 5 .—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk  of death with his own consent.  \\n  \", metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\lawsections\\\\LawSections.pdf', 'page': 69}),\n",

Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.  \\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the \\ndog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as  Z's dog has begun to fol low A.  \\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may \\ndishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has c ommitted theft of the treasure.  \\n(d) A being Z's servant , and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's \\nconsent. A has committed theft.  \\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a \\ngoldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has \\nnot committed theft, though he may have comm itted criminal breach of trust.  \\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in t he house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A \\ndishonest ly removes it, A commits theft.  \\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the high road, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he \\nmay commit criminal  misappropriation of proper ty. \\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \\nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will eve r be found by Z, with the \\n                                                           \\n1.

Here A, at the time of first moving the \\nring, commits theft.  \\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to  his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's  hand, \\nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal tres pass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \\nwhat he di d was not done dishonestly.  \\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes \\nthe watch out of Z's possession, wit h the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, \\ninasm uch as he takes it dishonestly.  \\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he \\nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasm uch as he takes it dishonestly.  \\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he \\nobtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft.  \\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express \\nconsent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived \\nthat he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impress ion, A has not committed theft.  \\n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clo thes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it \\nis probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authori sed to give away alms. If this was A's impress ion, A has not committed \\ntheft.  \\n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \\nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property  dishonestly, he commits theft.  \\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that pro perty out of B's possession. \\nHere, as A does not take dishone stly, he does not commit theft.  \\n379.

Extortion .—Whoever intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury to that person, or to any \\nother, and thereby dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any property, or \\nvaluable security or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security, commits \\n“extortion ”. \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A threatens to publish a defamatory libel concerning Z unless Z gives him money.

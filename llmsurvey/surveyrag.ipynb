The larger PLMs bring more performance\\ngains, which has led to the transitioning of PLMs to LLMs by\\nsignificantly increasing model parameters (tens to hundreds of\\nbillions) [10] and training dataset (many GBs and TBs) [10],\\n[11]. Following this development, numerous LLMs have been\\nproposed in the literature [10], [11], [12], [6], [13], [14], [15].\\nAn increasing trend in the number of released LLMs and\\nnames of a few significant LLMs proposed over the years are\\nshown in Fig 1 and Fig 2, respectively.\\nThe early work on LLMs, such as T5 [10] and mT5 [11]\\nemployed transfer learning until GPT-3 [6] showing LLMs are\\nzero-shot transferable to downstream tasks without fine-tuning.\\nLLMs accurately respond to task queries when prompted\\nwith task descriptions and examples.

B ACKGROUND\\nWe provide the relevant background to understand the\\nfundamentals related to LLMs in this section. Aligned with\\nour objective of providing a comprehensive overview of this\\ndirection, this section offers a comprehensive yet concise\\noutline of the basic concepts. We focus more on the intuitive\\naspects and refer the readers interested in details to the original\\nworks.\\nA. Tokenization\\nLLMs are trained on text to predict text, and similar to\\nother natural language processing systems, they use tokeniza-\\ntion [55] as the essential preprocessing step. It aims to parse\\nthe text into non-decomposing units called tokens. Tokens\\ncan be characters, subwords [56], symbols [57], or words,\\ndepending on the size and type of the model. Some of the\\ncommonly used tokenization schemes in LLMs are briefed\\nhere. Readers are encouraged to refer to [58] for a detailed\\nsurvey.\\n1. WordPiece [59]: It was introduced in [59] as a novel text\\nsegmentation technique for Japanese and Korean languages to\\nimprove the language model for voice search systems. Word-\\nPiece selects tokens that increase the likelihood of an n-gram-\\nbased language model trained on the vocabulary composed of\\ntokens.\\n2. BPE [57]: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) has its origin in\\ncompression algorithms. It is an iterative process of generating\\ntokens where pairs of adjacent symbols are replaced by a new\\nsymbol, and the occurrences of the most occurring symbols in\\nthe input text are merged.\\n3. UnigramLM [56]: In this tokenization, a simple unigram\\nlanguage model (LM) is trained using an initial vocabulary\\nofsubword units. The vocabulary is pruned iteratively by\\nremoving the lowest probability items from the list, which\\nare the worst performing on the unigram LM.\\nB. Attention\\nAttention, particularly selective attention , has been widely\\nstudied under perception, psychophysics, and psychology. Se-\\nlective attention can be conceived as “the programming by\\nthe O of which stimuli will be processed or encoded and in\\nwhat order this will occur” [60]. While this definition has itsroots in visual perception, it has uncanny similarities with the\\nrecently formulated attention [61], [62] (which stimuli will\\nbe processed) and positional encoding (in what order this\\nwill occur) [62] in LLMs. We discuss both in sections II-C\\nand II-D, respectively.\\nC. Attention in LLMs\\nThe attention mechanism computes a representation of the\\ninput sequences by relating different positions ( tokens ) of these\\nsequences. There are various approaches to calculating and\\nimplementing attention, out of which some famous types are\\ngiven below.\\n1. Self-Attention [62]: The self-attention is also known as\\nintra-attention since all the queries, keys, and values come\\nfrom the same block (encoder or decoder). The self-attention\\nlayer connects all the sequence positions with O(1)space\\ncomplexity which is highly desirable for learning long-range\\ndependencies in the input.\\n2. Cross Attention: In encoder-decoder architectures, the\\noutputs of the encoder blocks act as the queries to the\\nintermediate representation of the decoder, which provides the\\nkeys and values to calculate a representation of the decoder\\nconditioned on the encoder. This attention is called cross-\\nattention.\\n3. Full Attention: The naive implementation of calculating\\nself-attention is known as full attention.\\n4. Sparse Attention [63]: The self-attention has a time\\ncomplexity of O(n2), which becomes prohibitive when scaling\\nthe LLMs to large context windows. An approximation to the\\nself-attention was proposed in [63], which greatly enhanced\\nthe capacity of GPT series LLMs to process a greater number\\nof input tokens in a reasonable time.\\n5. Flash Attention [64]: The bottleneck for calculating the\\nattention using GPUs lies in the memory access rather than the\\ncomputational speed. Flash Attention uses the classical input\\ntiling approach to process the blocks of the input in GPU on-\\nchip SRAM rather than doing IO for every token from the High\\nBandwith Memory (HBM). An extension of this approach to\\nsparse attention follows the speed gains of the full attention\\nimplementation. This trick allows even greater context-length\\nwindows in the LLMs as compared to those LLMs with sparse\\nattention.\\nD. Encoding Positions\\nTheattention modules do not consider the order of process-\\ning by design. Transformer [62] introduced “positional encod-\\nings” to feed information about the position of the tokens in\\ninput sequences. Several variants of positional encoding have\\nbeen proposed [65], [66]. Interestingly, a recent study [67]\\nsuggests that adding this information may not matter for the\\nstate-of-the-art decoder-only Transformers.\\n1. Absolute: This is the most straightforward approach to\\nadding the sequence order information by assigning a unique\\nidentifier to each position of the sequence before passing it to\\nthe attention module.', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PREPRINT 5\\n2. Relative: To pass the information on the relative depen-\\ndencies of different tokens appearing at different locations in\\nthe sequence, a relative positional encoding is calculated by\\nsome kind of learning. Two famous types of relative encodings\\nare:\\nAlibi: [65] In this approach, a scalar bias is subtracted from\\nthe attention score calculated using two tokens which increases\\nwith the distance between the positions of the tokens. This\\nlearned approach effectively favors using recent tokens for\\nattention.\\nRoPE: Keys, queries, and values are all vectors in the LLMs.\\nRoPE [66] involves the rotation of the query and key represen-\\ntations at an angle proportional to their absolute positions of\\nthe tokens in the input sequence. This step results in a relative\\npositional encoding scheme which decays with the distance\\nbetween the tokens.\\nE. Activation Functions\\nThe activation functions serve a crucial role in the curve-\\nfitting abilities of the neural networks, as proved in [68]. The\\nmodern activation functions used in LLMs are different from\\nthe earlier squashing functions but are critical to the success\\nof LLMs. We discuss these activation functions in this section.\\n1. ReLU [69]: Rectified linear unit (ReLU) is defined as\\nReLU (x) =max(0, x) (1)\\n2. GeLU [70]: Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GeLU) is the\\ncombination of ReLU, dropout [71] and zoneout [72]. It is the\\nmost widely used activation function in contemporary LLM\\nliterature.\\n3. GLU variants [73]: Gated Linear Unit [74] is a neural\\nnetwork layer that is an element-wise product ( ⊗) of a linear\\ntransformation and a sigmoid transformed ( σ) linear projection\\nof the input given as\\nGLU (x, W, V, b, c ) = (xW+b)⊗σ(xV+c), (2)\\nwhere Xis the input of layer and l,W, b, V andcare learned\\nparameters.\\nGLU was modified in [73] to evaluate the effect of different\\nvariations in the training and testing of transformers, resulting\\nin better empirical results. Here are the different GLU varia-\\ntions introduced in [73] and used in LLMs.\\nReGLU (x, W, V, b, c ) =max(0, xW +b)⊗,\\nGEGLU (x, W, V, b, c ) =GELU (xW+b)⊗(xV+c),\\nSwiGLU (x, W, V, b, c, β ) =Swishβ (xW+b)⊗(xV+c).\\nF . Layer Normalization\\nLayer normalization leads to faster convergence and is a\\nwidely used component in transformers. In this section, we\\nprovide different normalization techniques widely used in\\nLLM literature.1. LayerNorm: Layer norm computes statistics over all the\\nhidden units in a layer (l)as follows:\\nul=1\\nnnX\\nial\\ni σl=vuut1\\nnnX\\ni(al\\ni−ul)2, (3)\\nwhere nis the number of neurons in the layer landal\\niis the\\nsummed input of the ineuron in layer l. LayerNorm provides\\ninvariance to rescaling of the weights and re-centering of the\\ndistribution.\\n2. RMSNorm: [75] proposed that the invariance properties\\nof LayerNorm are spurious, and we can achieve the same\\nperformance benefits as we get from LayerNorm by using a\\ncomputationally efficient normalization technique that trades\\noff re-centering invariance with speed. LayerNorm gives the\\nnormalized summed input to layer las follows\\nal\\ni=al\\ni−ul\\nσgl\\ni (4)\\nwhere gl\\niis the gain parameter. RMSNorm [75] modifies al\\ni\\nas\\nal\\ni=al\\ni\\nRMS(al)gl\\ni,where RMS (al) =vuut1\\nnnX\\ni(al\\ni)2.(5)\\n3. Pre-Norm and Post-Norm: LLMs use transformer [62]\\narchitecture with some variations. The original implementa-\\ntion [62] used layer normalization after the residual con-\\nnection, commonly called post-LN, concerning the order of\\nMultihead attention – Residual – LN . There is another order\\nof the normalization, referred to as pre-LN [76] due to the\\nposition of the normalization step before the self-attention\\nlayer as in LN – Multihead attention – Residual . Pre-LN is\\nknown to provide more stability in the training [77].\\n4. DeepNorm: While pre-LN has certain benefits over post-\\nLN training, pre-LN training has an unwanted effect on the\\ngradients [77]. The earlier layers have larger gradients than\\nthose at the bottom. DeepNorm [78] mitigates these adverse\\neffects on the gradients. It is given as\\nxlf=LN(αxlp+Glp(xlp, θlp), (6)\\nwhere αis a constant and θlprepresents the parameters of\\nlayer lp. These parameters are scaled by another constant β.\\nBoth of these constants depend only on the architecture.\\nG. Distributed LLM Training\\nThis section describes distributed LLM training approaches\\nbriefly. More details are available in [13], [37], [79], [80].\\n1. Data Parallelism: Data parallelism replicates the model\\non multiple devices where data in a batch gets divided across\\ndevices. At the end of each training iteration weights are\\nsynchronized across all devices.\\n2. Tensor Parallelism: Tensor parallelism shards a tensor\\ncomputation across devices. It is also known as horizontal\\nparallelism or intra-layer model parallelism.', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PREPRINT 6\\n3. Pipeline Parallelism: Pipeline parallelism shards model\\nlayers across different devices. This is also known as vertical\\nparallelism.\\n4. Model Parallelism: A combination of tensor and pipeline\\nparallelism is known as model parallelism.\\n5. 3D Parallelism: A combination of data, tensor, and\\nmodel parallelism is known as 3D parallelism.\\n6. Optimizer Parallelism: Optimizer parallelism also\\nknown as zero redundancy optimizer [37] implements opti-\\nmizer state partitioning, gradient partitioning, and parameter\\npartitioning across devices to reduce memory consumption\\nwhile keeping the communication costs as low as possible.\\nH. Libraries\\nSome commonly used libraries for LLMs training are: 1)\\nTransformers [81], 2) DeepSpeed [36], 3) Megatron-LM [79],\\n4) JAX [82], 5) Colossal-AI [83], 6) BMTrain [80], 7)\\nFastMoE [84], and frameworks are 1) MindSpore [85], 2)\\nPyTorch [86], 3) Tensorflow [87], 4) MXNet [88].\\nI. Data PreProcessing\\nThis section briefly summarizes data preprocessing tech-\\nniques used in LLMs training.\\n1. Quality Filtering: For better results, training data quality\\nis essential. Some approaches to filtering data are: 1) classifier-\\nbased and 2) heuristics-based. Classifier-based approaches\\ntrain a classifier on high-quality data and predict the quality of\\ntext for filtering, whereas heuristics-based employ some rules\\nfor filtering like language, metrics, statistics, and keywords.\\n2. Data Deduplication: Duplicated data can affect model\\nperformance and increase data memorization; therefore, to\\ntrain LLMs, data deduplication is one of the preprocessing\\nsteps. This can be performed at multiple levels, like sentences,\\ndocuments, and datasets.\\n3. Privacy Reduction: Most of the training data for LLMs\\nis collected through web sources. This data contains private\\ninformation; therefore, many LLMs employ heuristics-based\\nmethods to filter information such as names, addresses, and\\nphone numbers to avoid learning personal information.\\nJ. Architectures\\nHere we discuss the variants of the transformer architectures\\nat a higher level which arise due to the difference in the\\napplication of the attention and the connection of transformer\\nblocks. An illustration of attention patterns of these architec-\\ntures is shown in Figure 4.\\n1. Encoder Decoder: Transformers were originally de-\\nsigned as sequence transduction models and followed other\\nprevalent model architectures for machine translation systems.\\nThey selected encoder-decoder architecture to train human\\nlanguage translation tasks. This architecture is adopted by [10],\\n[89]. In this architectural scheme, an encoder encodes the\\ninput sequences to variable length context vectors, which are\\nthen passed to the decoder to maximize a joint objective of\\nminimizing the gap between predicted token labels and the\\nactual target token labels.\\nFig. 4: An example of attention patterns in language models,\\nimage is taken from [91].\\nFig. 5: An example of language model training objectives,\\nimage from [91].\\n2. Causal Decoder: The underlying objective of an LLM\\nis to predict the next token based on the input sequence. While\\nadditional information from the encoder binds the prediction\\nstrongly to the context, it is found in practice that the LLMs\\ncan perform well in the absence of encoder [90], relying\\nonly on the decoder. Similar to the original encoder-decoder\\narchitecture’s decoder block, this decoder restricts the flow\\nof information backward, i.e., the predicted token tkonly\\ndepends on the tokens preceded by and up to tk−1. This is\\nthe most widely used variant in the state-of-the-art LLMs.\\n3. Prefix Decoder: The causal masked attention is reason-\\nable in the encoder-decoder architectures where the encoder\\ncan attend to all the tokens in the sentence from every position\\nusing self-attention. This means that the encoder can also\\nattend to tokens tk+1totnin addition to the tokens from t1\\ntotk−1while calculating the representation for tk. But when\\nwe drop the encoder and only keep the decoder, we also lose\\nthis flexibility in attention. A variation in the decoder-only\\narchitectures is by changing the mask from strictly causal to\\nfully visible on a portion of the input sequence, as shown\\nin Figure 4. The Prefix decoder is also known as non-causal\\ndecoder architecture.\\nK. Pre-Training Objectives\\nThis section describes LLMs pre-training objectives. For\\nmore details see the paper [91].\\n1. Full Language Modeling: An autoregressive language\\nmodeling objective where the model is asked to predict future\\ntokens given the previous tokens, an example is shown in\\nFigure 5.\\n2. Prefix Language Modeling: A non-causal training objec-\\ntive, where a prefix is chosen randomly and only remaining\\ntarget tokens are used to calculate the loss. An example is\\nshown in Figure 5.', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

Prompting LLMs\\nto generate responses is possible at different training stages like pre-training, instruction-tuning, or alignment tuning.\\n3. Masked Language Modeling: In this training objective,\\ntokens or spans (a sequence of tokens) are masked randomly\\nand the model is asked to predict masked tokens given the\\npast and future context. An example is shown in Figure 5.\\n4. Unified Language Modeling: Unified language model-\\ning [92] is a combination of causal, non-causal, and masked\\nlanguage training objectives. Here in masked language mod-\\neling, the attention is not bidirectional but unidirectional,\\nattending either left-to-right or right-to-left context.\\nL. Model Adaptation\\nThis section discusses the fundamentals of LLMs adaptation\\nstages, from pre-training to fine-tuning for downstream tasks\\nand utilization. An example of different training stages and\\ninference in LLMs is shown in Figure 6. In this paper, we refer\\nalignment-tuning to aligning with human preferences, while\\noccasionally the literature uses the term alignment for different\\npurposes.\\n1. Pre-Training: In the very first stage, the model is trained\\nin a self-supervised manner on a large corpus to predict the\\nnext tokens given the input. The design choices of LLMs vary\\nfrom encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures with dif-ferent building blocks and loss functions in sections II-F, II-E,\\nII-K.\\n2. Fine-Tuning: There are different styles to fine-tune an\\nLLM. This section briefly discusses fine-tuning approaches.\\nTransfer Learning: The pre-trained LLMs perform well for\\nvarious tasks [6], [15]. But to improve the performance for\\na downstream task, pre-trained models are fine-tuned with\\nthe task-specific data [10], [11], known as transfer learning.\\nInstruction-tuning: To enable a model to respond to user\\nqueries effectively, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on\\ninstruction formatted data i.e., instruction and an input-output\\npair. Instructions generally comprise multi-task data in plain\\nnatural language, guiding the model to respond according to\\nthe prompt and the input. This type of fine-tuning improves\\nzero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.\\nDetails on formatting instruction data and its various styles\\nare available in [16], [46], [93].\\nAlignment-tuning: LLMs are prone to generate false, biased,\\nand harmful text. To make them helpful, honest, and harmless\\nmodels are aligned using human feedback. Alignment involves\\nasking LLMs to generate unexpected responses and then\\nupdating their parameters to avoid such responses [20], [21],\\n[94].', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

A model is defined to be an “aligned” model if the\\nmodel fulfills three criteria of helpful, honest, and harmless or\\n“HHH” [95].\\nResearchers employ reinforcement learning with human feed-\\nback (RLHF) [96] for model alignment. In RLHF, a fine-\\ntuned model on demonstrations is further trained with reward\\nmodeling (RM) and reinforcement learning (RL), shown in\\nFigure 6. Below we briefly discuss RM and RL pipelines in\\nRLHF.\\nReward modeling: trains a model to rank generated responses\\naccording to human preferences using a classification objec-\\ntive. To train the classifier humans annotate LLMs generated\\nresponses based on HHH criteria.\\nReinforcement learning: in combination with the reward model\\nis used for alignment in the next stage. The previously trained\\nreward model ranks LLM-generated responses into preferred\\nvs. dispreferred, which is used to align the model with proxi-\\nmal policy optimization (PPO). This process repeats iteratively\\nuntil convergence.\\n3. Prompting/Utilization: Prompting is a method to query\\ntrained LLMs for generating responses, as illustrated in Fig-\\nure 6. LLMs can be prompted in various prompt setups,\\nwhere they can be adapted to the instructions without fine-\\ntuning and in other cases with fine-tuning on data containing\\ndifferent prompt styles [16], [97], [98]. A good guide on\\nprompt engineering is available at [32]. Below, we will discuss\\nvarious widely used prompt setups.\\nZero-Shot Prompting: LLMs are zero-shot learners and ca-\\npable of answering queries never seen before. This style of\\nprompting requires LLMs to answer user questions without\\nseeing any examples in the prompt.\\nIn-context Learning: Also known as few-shot learning, here,\\nmultiple input-output demonstration pairs are shown to the\\nmodel to generate the desired response. This adaptation style\\nis also called few-shot learning. A discussion on formatting\\nin-context learning (ICL) templates is available in [50], [46],\\n[18], [16].\\nReasoning in LLMs: LLMs are zero-shot reasoners and can\\nbe provoked to generate answers to logical problems, task\\nplanning, critical thinking, etc. with reasoning. Generating\\nreasons is possible only by using different prompting styles,\\nwhereas to improve LLMs further on reasoning tasks many\\nmethods [16], [93] train them on reasoning datasets. We\\ndiscuss various prompting techniques for reasoning below.\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT): A special case of prompting where\\ndemonstrations contain reasoning information aggregated with\\ninputs and outputs so that the model generates outcomes\\nwith step-by-step reasoning. More details on CoT prompts are\\navailable in [51], [99], [97].\\nSelf-Consistency: Improves CoT performance by generat-\\ning multiple responses and selecting the most frequent an-\\nswer [100].\\nTree-of-Thought (ToT): Explores multiple reasoning paths\\nwith possibilities to look ahead and backtrack for problem-\\nsolving [101].\\nSingle-Turn Instructions: In this prompting setup, LLMs\\nare queried only once with all the relevant information in\\nFig. 7: Unified text-to-text training example, source image\\nfrom [10].\\nthe prompt. LLMs generate responses by understanding the\\ncontext either in a zero-shot or few-shot setting.\\nMulti-Turn Instructions: Solving a complex task requires\\nmultiple interactions with LLMs, where feedback and re-\\nsponses from the other tools are given as input to the LLM\\nfor the next rounds. This style of using LLMs in the loop is\\ncommon in autonomous agents.\\nIII. L ARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\\nThis section reviews LLMs, briefly describing their architec-\\ntures, training objectives, pipelines, datasets, and fine-tuning\\ndetails.\\nA. Pre-Trained LLMs\\nHere, we provide summaries of various well-known pre-\\ntrained LLMs with significant discoveries, changing the course\\nof research and development in NLP. These LLMs have\\nconsiderably improved the performance in NLU and NLG\\ndomains, and are widely fine-tuned for downstream tasks.\\n1. General Purpose:\\n1.1 T5 [10]: An encoder-decoder model employing a\\nunified text-to-text training for all NLP problems, shown in\\nFigure 7. T5 places layer normalization outside the residual\\npath in a conventional transformer model [62]. It uses masked\\nlanguage modeling as a pre-training objective where spans\\n(consecutive tokens) are replaced with a single mask instead of\\nseparate masks for each token. This type of masking speeds\\nup the training as it produces shorter sequences. After pre-\\ntraining, the model is fine-tuned using adapter layers [102]\\nfor downstream tasks.\\n1.2 GPT-3 [6]: The GPT-3 architecture is same as the\\nGPT-2 [5] but with dense and sparse attention in transformer\\nlayers similar to the Sparse Transformer [63]. It shows that\\nlarge models can train on larger batch sizes with a lower\\nlearning rate; in order to decide the batch size during training,\\nGPT-3 uses the gradient noise scale as in [103]. Overall,\\nGPT-3 increases model parameters to 175B showing that the\\nperformance of large language models improves with the scale\\nand is competitive with the fine-tuned models.\\n1.3 mT5 [11]: A multilingual T5 model [10] trained on\\nthe mC4 dataset with 101 languages. The dataset is extracted\\nfrom the public common crawl scrape.

Moreover,\\nto use the model for downstream tasks, CPM-2 experimented\\nwith both complete fine-tuning and prompt fine-tuning as\\nin [106] where only prompt-related parameters are updated\\nby inserting prompts at various positions, front, middle, and\\nback. CPM-2 also proposes INFMOE, a memory-efficient\\nframework with a strategy to dynamically offload parameters\\nto the CPU for inference at a 100B scale. It overlaps data\\nmovement with inference computation for lower inference\\ntime.\\n1.6 ERNIE 3.0 [107]: ERNIE 3.0 takes inspiration from\\nmulti-task learning to build a modular architecture using\\nTransformer-XL [108] as the backbone. The universal repre-\\nsentation module is shared by all the tasks, which serve as the\\nbasic block for task-specific representation modules, which are\\nall trained jointly for natural language understanding, natural\\nlanguage generation, and knowledge extraction.

In practice, the Yuan 1.0 model\\nperforms well on text classification, Winograd Schema, natural\\nlanguage inference, and reading comprehension tasks.\\n1.10 Gopher [113]: The Gopher family of models ranges\\nfrom 44M to 280B parameters in size to study the effect of\\nscale on the LLMs performance. The 280B model beats GPT-\\n3 [6], Jurrasic-1 [109], MT-NLG [114], and others on 81% of\\nthe evaluated tasks.\\n1.11 ERNIE 3.0 TITAN [35]: ERNIE 3.0 Titan extends\\nERNIE 3.0 by training a larger model with 26x the number of\\nparameters of the latter. This bigger model outperformed other\\nstate-of-the-art models in 68 NLP tasks. LLMs produce text\\nwith incorrect facts. In order to have control of the generated\\ntext with factual consistency, ERNIE 3.0 Titan adds another\\ntask, Credible and Controllable Generations , to its multi-\\ntask learning setup. It introduces additional self-supervised\\nadversarial and controllable language modeling losses to the\\npre-training step, which enables ERNIE 3.0 Titan to beat\\nother LLMs in their manually selected Factual QA task set\\nevaluations.\\n1.12 GPT-NeoX-20B [115]: An auto-regressive model\\nthat largely follows GPT-3 with a few deviations in architec-\\nture design, trained on the Pile dataset without any data dedu-\\nplication. GPT-NeoX has parallel attention and feed-forward\\nlayers in a transformer block, given in Eq. 8, that increases\\nthroughput by 15%. It uses rotary positional embedding [66],\\napplying it to only 25% of embedding vector dimension as\\nin [116]. This reduces the computation without performance\\ndegradation. Opposite to GPT-3, which uses dense and sparse\\nlayers, GPT-NeoX-20B uses only dense layers.

However, because they are generally trained with\\nthe objective of next token prediction, LLMs have limited\\ncapacity to follow user intent and are prone to generate\\nunethical, toxic or inaccurate responses [20]. For their effective\\nutilization, LLMs are fine-tuned to follow instructions [16],\\n[17], [93] and generate safe responses [20], which also results\\nin increasing zero-shot, few-shot, and cross-task generaliza-\\ntion [93], [16], [18], with minimal compute increment, e.g.,\\n0.2% of the total pre-training for PaLM 540B [16].\\nWe review various fine-tuned LLMs and strategies for effective\\nfine-tuning in this section.\\n1. Instruction-Tuning with Manually Created Datasets:\\nNumerous hand-crafted instruction-tuning datasets with\\ndifferent design choices are proposed in the literature to\\ninstruction-tune LLMs. The performance of fine-tuned LLMs\\ndepends on multiple factors, such as dataset, instruction\\ndiversity, prompting templates, model size, and training\\nobjectives. Keeping this in view, diverse fine-tuned models\\nhave emerged in the literature using manually created datasets.\\nThe models T0 [17] and mT0 (multi-lingual) [145] employ\\ntemplates to convert existing datasets into prompt datasets.\\nThey have shown improvements in generalization to zero-shot\\nand held-out tasks. Tk-Instruct [18] fine-tuned the T5 model\\nwith in-context instructions to study generalization on unseen\\ntasks when given in-context instructions during test time. The\\nFig. 11: An example image shows an instance of the Flan\\ntraining paradigm, taken from [16].\\nmodel outperformed Instruct-GPT, despite being smaller in\\nsize, i.e., 11B parameters as compared to 175B of GPT-3.\\nIncreasing Tasks and Prompt Setups: Zero-shot and few-\\nshot performance improves significantly by expanding task\\ncollection and prompt styles. OPT-IML [93] and Flan [16]\\ncurated larger 2k and 1.8k task datasets, respectively. While\\nincreasing task size alone is not enough, OPT-IML and\\nFlan add more prompting setups in their datasets, zero-shot,\\nfew-shot, and CoT. In continuation, CoT Collection [97]\\nfine-tunes Flan-T5 further on 1.88M CoT samples. Another\\nmethod [98] uses symbolic tasks with tasks in T0, Flan, etc.\\n2. Instruction-Tuning with LLMs Generated Datasets:\\nGenerating an instruction-tuning dataset requires carefully\\nwriting instructions and input-output pairs, which are often\\nwritten by humans, smaller in size, and less diverse. To\\novercome this, self-instruct [19] proposed an approach to\\nprompt available LLMs to generate instruction-tuning datasets.\\nSelf-instruct outperformed models trained on manually created\\ndataset SUPER-NATURALINSTRUCTIONS (a dataset with\\n1600+ tasks) [18] by 33%. It starts with a seed of 175 tasks,\\n1 instruction, and 1 sample per task and iteratively generates\\nnew instructions (52k) and instances (82k input-output pairs)\\nusing GPT-3 [6]. Contrary to this, Dynosaur [146] uses the\\nmeta-data of datasets on Huggingface to prompt LLMs to\\ngenerate multiple task instruction-tuning datasets.\\nLLaMA Tuned: Various models in literature instruction-tune\\nLLaMA [147] with GPT-3 [6] or GPT-4 [148] generated\\ndatasets.

Direct preference\\noptimization (DPO) [159] trains a model directly on the\\nhuman-preferred responses to maximize the likelihood of\\npreferred against unpreferred responses, with per-sample\\nimportance weight. Reward ranked fine-tuning RAFT [160]\\nfine-tunes the model on ranked responses by the reward\\nmodel. Preference ranking optimization (PRO) [162] and\\nRRHF [161] penalize the model to rank responses with\\nhuman preferences and supervised loss. On the other hand,\\nchain-of-hindsight (CoH) [163] provides feedback to the\\nmodel in language rather than reward, to learn good versus\\nbad responses.\\nAligning with Synthetic Feedback: Aligning LLMs with\\nhuman feedback is slow and costly. The literature suggests a\\nsemi-automated process to align LLMs by prompting LLMs togenerate helpful, honest, and ethical responses to the queries,\\nand fine-tuning using the newly created dataset. Constitutional\\nAI [164] replaces human feedback in RLHF with AI, calling\\nit RL from AI feedback (RLAIF).

The self-correction prompting in [167] concatenates\\ninstructions and CoT with questions, guiding the model to\\nanswer its instruction following strategy to ensure moral\\nsafety before the actual answer.

The models are susceptible to generating harmful\\nresponses even though they are aligned for safety [168],\\n[169]. Red-teaming is a common approach to address\\nillicit outputs, where the LLMs are prompted to generate\\nharmful outputs [169], [170]. The dataset collected through\\nred-teaming is used to fine-tune models for safety. While\\nred-teaming largely relies on human annotators, another\\nwork [171] red-team LLMs to find prompts that lead to\\nharmful outputs of other LLMs.\\n4. Continue Pre-Training: Although fine-tuning boosts a\\nmodel’s performance, it leads to catastrophic forgetting of\\npreviously learned information. Concatenating fine-tuning data\\nwith a few randomly selected pre-training samples in every\\niteration avoids network forgetting [172], [143]. This is also\\neffective in adapting LLMs for cases where fine-tuning data is\\nsmall and the original capacity is to be maintained. Prompt-\\nbased continued pre-training (PCP) [173] trains the model\\nwith text and instructions related to tasks and then finally\\ninstruction-tunes the model for downstream tasks.\\n5. Sample Efficiency: While fine-tuning data is generally\\nmany-fold smaller than the pre-training data, it still has to\\nbe large enough for acceptable performance [16], [93], [18]\\nand requires proportional computing resources. To study the\\neffects on performance with less data, existing literature [174],\\n[175] finds that the models trained on lesser data can out-\\nperform models trained with more data. In [174], 25% of\\nthe total downstream data is found enough for state-of-the-\\nart performance. Selecting coreset-based 0.5% of the total\\ninstruction-tuning data improves the model performance by\\n2% in [175], as compared to the complete data tuning. Less\\nis more for alignment (LIMA) [176] uses only 1000 carefully\\ncreated demonstrations to fine-tune the model and has achieved\\ncomparable performance to GPT-4.\\nC. Increasing Context Window\\nLLMs are trained with limited context windows due to\\nexpensive attention and high memory requirements. A model\\ntrained on limited sequence lengths fails to generalize to\\nunseen lengths at inference time [177], [45]. Alternatively,\\nLLMs with ALiBi [65] positional encodings can perform zero-\\nshot length extrapolation. However, ALiBi has less expres-\\nsive power [66] and inferior performance on multiple bench-\\nmarks [42], and many LLMs use RoPE positional embedding\\nthat is unable to perform zero-shot extrapolation. A larger con-\\ntext length has benefits such as a better understanding of longer\\ndocuments, more samples in in-context learning, execution\\nof bigger reasoning processes, etc. Expanding context length\\nduring fine-tuning is slow, inefficient, and computationally\\nexpensive [45]. Therefore, researchers employ various context\\nwindow extrapolation techniques discussed below.\\nPosition Interpolation: Rather than extrapolating, [45] shows\\nthat interpolating position encodings within the pre-trained\\ncontext window are more effective. The work demonstrates\\nthat only 1000 steps of fine-tuning are enough to achieve betterresults on larger windows without performance loss compared\\nto the original context size. Giraffe [42] uses power scaling in\\nRoPE, and YaRN [43] proposed NTK-aware interpolation.\\nEfficient Attention Mechanism: Dense global attention is\\none of the major constraints in training larger context win-\\ndow LLMs. Using efficient attention variants, such as local,\\nsparse, and dilated attention, reduces the computation cost\\nsignificantly. LongT5 [44] proposes transient global attention\\n(TGlobal), applying attention to local and global tokens (win-\\ndowing token averaging). The model replaces attention in\\nT5 [10] with TGlobal attention, pre-trains the model on 4098\\nsequence length, fine-tunes on larger window sizes, as large\\nas 16k, and improves task performance with longer inputs.\\nThis shows the extrapolation ability of TGlobal attention\\nwith only fine-tuning. COLT5 [178] uses two branches, one\\nwith lightweight and the other with heavyweight attention\\nand feed-forward layers. All tokens are processed from the\\nlightweight branch, and only important tokens are routed to\\nthe heavyweight branch. LongNet [179] replaces standard\\nattention with dilated attention, expanding sequence length to 1\\nbillion tokens. LongLoRA [180] proposes shift-short attention,\\nused during fine-tuning to reduce dense attention costs, while\\nthe model during inference can use dense attention and achieve\\nsimilar performance as full attention fine-tuning.\\nExtrapolation without Training: LM-Infinite [177] and par-\\nallel context windows (PCW) [181] show length extrapolation\\nis possible using pre-trained LLMs. LM-Infinite suggested Λ-\\nshaped attention applied within the original context window\\nlimits. Likewise, PCW chunks larger inputs into the pre-trained\\ncontext lengths and applies the same positional encodings to\\neach chunk.\\nD. Robotics\\nLLMs have been rapidly adopted across various domains in\\nthe scientific community due to their multipurpose capabili-\\nties [46]. In robotics research, the LLMs have very promising\\napplications as well, such as enhancing human-robot inter-\\naction [28], [182], [183], [184], task planning [185], [186],\\n[187], navigation [188], [189], and learning [190], [191].\\nThey can enable robots to understand and generate natural\\nlanguage, aiding in instruction following, data annotation, and\\ncollaborative problem-solving.

This can help robots acquire new\\nskills, adapt to changes, and refine their performance based on\\nreal-time data.\\nLLMs have also started assisting in simulating environments\\nfor testing and offer potential for innovative research in\\nrobotics, despite challenges like bias mitigation and integration\\ncomplexity. The work in [192] focuses on personalizing robot\\nhousehold cleanup tasks. By combining language-based plan-\\nning and perception with LLMs, such that having users provide\\nobject placement examples, which the LLM summarizes to\\ngenerate generalized preferences, they show that robots can\\ngeneralize user preferences from a few examples.

They analyze visual and spatial information to\\ndetermine the most effective approach to interact with ob-\\njects, proving invaluable in operations requiring precision and\\nflexibility, such as surgical procedures or assembly line tasks.\\nThey also enable the integration of sensor inputs and linguistic\\ncues in an embodied framework, enhancing decision-making\\nin real-world scenarios. It enhances the model’s performance\\nacross various embodied tasks by allowing it to gather insights\\nand generalize from diverse training data spanning language\\nand vision domains.\\nNavigation: LLMs have revolutionized the navigation in\\nrobotics [200], [201], [202], [203], offering significant poten-\\ntial to enhance a robot’s ability to navigate complex environ-\\nments with precision and adaptability. Motion planning [188],\\nin particular, stands out as a critical domain where LLMs have\\nshown remarkable promise, excelling in generating feasible\\npaths and trajectories for robots, accounting for intricate\\nenvironmental details. This ability proves particularly valuable\\nin scenarios requiring precise and dynamically adaptable navi-\\ngation, as observed in environments like warehouses, transportand healthcare facilities, and smart residences.

Multimodal LLMs\\nInspired by the success of LLMs in natural language pro-\\ncessing applications, an increasing number of research works\\nare now facilitating LLMs to perceive different modalities\\nof information like image [204], [205], [206], video [207],\\n[208], [209], audio [210], [209], [211], etc.Multimodal LLMs\\n(MLLMs) present substantial benefits compared to standard\\nLLMs that process only text. By incorporating information\\nfrom various modalities, MLLMs can achieve a deeper un-\\nderstanding of context, leading to more intelligent responses\\ninfused with a variety of expressions. Importantly, MLLMs\\nalign closely with human perceptual experiences, leveraging\\nthe synergistic nature of our multisensory inputs to form\\na comprehensive understanding of the world [211], [26].\\nCoupled with a user-friendly interface, MLLMs can offer\\nintuitive, flexible, and adaptable interactions, allowing users\\nto engage with intelligent assistants through a spectrum of\\ninput methods. According to the ways of constructing models,\\ncurrent MLLMs can be generally divided into three streams:\\npre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. In this section, we\\nwill discuss more details of these main streams, as well as the\\nimportant application of MLLMs in visual reasoning.\\nPre-training: This stream of MLLMs intends to support differ-\\nent modalities using unified end-to-end models. For instance,\\nFlamingo [204] applies gated cross-attention to fuse vision and\\nlanguage modalities, which are collected from pre-trained and\\nfrozen visual encoder and LLM, respectively. Moreover, BLIP-\\n2 [205] proposes a two-stage strategy to pre-train a Querying\\nTransformer (Q-Former) for the alignment between vision\\nand language modalities: in the first stage, vision-language\\nrepresentation learning is bootstrapped from a frozen visual\\nencoder; and in the second stage, a frozen LLM bootstraps\\nvision-to-language generative learning for zero-shot image-\\nto-text generation. Similarly, MiniGPT-4 [212] also deploys\\npre-trained and frozen ViT [213], Q-Former and Vicuna\\nLLM [150], while only a linear projection layer needs to be\\ntrained for vision and language modalities alignment.\\nFine-tuning: Derived from instruction tuning [16] for NLP\\ntasks [20], [16], [93], researchers are now fine-tuning pre-\\ntrained LLMs using multimodal instructions. Following this', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PREPRINT 18\\nmethod, LLMs can be easily and effectively extended as\\nmultimodal chatbots [212], [206], [29] and multimodal task\\nsolvers [214], [30], [215]. The key issue of this stream of\\nMLLMs is to collect multimodal instruction-following data for\\nfine-tuning [216]. To address this issue, the solutions of bench-\\nmark adaptation [214], [217], [218], self-instruction [19], [31],\\n[219], and hybrid composition [220], [215] are employed,\\nrespectively. To mitigate the gap between the original language\\nmodality and additional modalities, the learnable interface is\\nintroduced to connect different modalities from frozen pre-\\ntrained models. Particularly, the learnable interface is expected\\nto work in a parameter-efficient tuning manner: e.g., LLaMA-\\nAdapter [221] applies an efficient transformer-based adapter\\nmodule for training, and LaVIN [220] dynamically learns\\nthe multimodal feature weights using a mixture-of-modality\\nadapter. Different from the learnable interface, the expert mod-\\nels can directly convert multimodalities into language: e.g.,\\nVideoChat-Text [207] incorporates Whisper [222], a speech\\nrecognition expert model, to generate the captions of given\\nvideos for the understanding of following LLMs.\\nPrompting: Different from the fine-tuning technique that\\ndirectly updates the model parameters given task-specific\\ndatasets, the prompting technique provides certain context,\\nexamples, or instructions to the model, fulfilling specialized\\ntasks without changing the model parameters. Since prompting\\ncan significantly reduce the need for large-scale multimodal\\ndata, this technique is widely used to construct MLLMs.\\nParticularly, to solve multimodal Chain of Thought (CoT)\\nproblems [99], LLMs are prompted to generate both the rea-\\nsoning process and the answer given multimodal inputs [223].\\nOn this front, different learning paradigms are exploited in\\npractice: for example, Multimodal-CoT [223] involves two\\nstages of rationale generation and answer inference, where the\\ninput of the second stage is a combination of the original input\\nand the output of the first stage; and CoT-PT [224] applies\\nboth prompt tuning and specific visual bias to generate a chain\\nof reasoning implicitly. In addition to CoT problems, LLMs\\ncan also be prompted with multimodal descriptions and tools,\\neffectively dividing complex tasks into sub-tasks [225], [226].\\nVisual Reasoning Application: Recent visual reasoning sys-\\ntems [227], [228], [229], [230] tend to apply LLMs for better\\nvisual information analysis and visual-language integration.\\nDifferent from previous works [231], [232] that rely on limited\\nVQA datasets and small-scale neural networks, current LLM-\\naided methods offer benefits of stronger generalization ability,\\nemergent ability, and interactivity [216]. To realize visual rea-\\nsoning with the help of LLMs, prompting and fine-tuning tech-\\nniques can also be utilized: for example, PointClip V2 [228]\\napplies LLMs to generate 3D-specific prompts, which are\\nencoded as textual features and then combined with visual\\nfeatures for 3D recognition; and GPT4Tools [31] employs\\nLoRA [233] to fine-tune LLMs following tool-related instruc-\\ntions. Serving as a controller [230], decision maker [234], or\\nsemantics refiner [227], [235], LLMs significantly facilitates\\nthe progress of visual reasoning research.\\nFig. 12: A flow diagram of Retrieval Augmented LLMs. The\\nretriever extracts a similar context to the input and forwards\\nit to the LLM either in simple language or encoded through\\nFusion-in-Decoder (FiD). Depending on the task, retrieval and\\ngeneration may repeat multiple times.\\nF . Augmented LLMs\\nLLMs are capable of learning from the examples concate-\\nnated with the input, known as context augmentation, in-\\ncontext learning (ICL), or few-shot prompting. They show\\nexcellent generalization to unseen tasks with few-shot prompt-\\ning, enabling LLMs to answer queries beyond the capacity\\nacquired during training [6], [51]. These emergent abilities\\nallow for adapting the model without fine-tuning - a costly\\nprocess. Aside from this, hallucination, producing inaccurate,\\nunsafe or factually incorrect responses, is common for LLMs,\\nwhich is avoided by augmenting contextual data. While the\\nuser can provide in-context samples in the query [50], [32],\\nhere we specifically refer to the methods that access external\\nstorage programmatically, calling them augmented LLMs.\\nThe literature suggests various external memory designs to\\naugment LLMs, long-term [236], [237], [238], [239], short-\\nterm [240], symbolic [241], and non-symbolic [242], [243].\\nThe memory can be maintained in different formats such as\\ndocuments, vectors, or databases. A few systems maintain\\nintermediate memory representations to retain information\\nacross multiple iterations [239], [237], while others extract\\nimportant information from the datasets and save it in memory\\nfor recall [244]. The memory read and write operations are\\nperformed either with or without LLMs cooperation [237],\\n[245], [239], [246], acting as a feedback signal in [240]. We\\ndiscuss different types of augmented LLMs below.\\n1. Retrieval Augmented LLMs: LLMs may have limited\\nmemory and outdated information, leading to inaccurate\\nresponses. Retrieving relevant information from external\\nup-to-date storage enables the LLMs to accurately answer\\nwith references and utilize more information. With retrieval\\naugmentation, smaller models have been shown to perform\\nat par with larger models. For instance, the 11B model can\\nbecome competitive to 540B PaLM in [25] and 7.5B to 280B\\nGopher in [238]. Retrieval augmented language modeling\\n(RALM) has two major components, shown in Figure 12,\\nnamely: 1) retriever and 2) language model. In RALM, the\\nretriever plays a crucial role in driving LLM response, where', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PREPRINT 19\\nincorrect information can steer LLMs to false behavior. This\\nleads to the development of various methods to retrieve\\naccurate information and fuse with the query for better\\nperformance.\\nZero-Shot Retrieval Augmentation: This kind of\\naugmentation keeps the original LLM architecture and\\nweights unchanged and uses BM25 [247], nearest neighbors,\\nor frozen pre-trained models like Bert [7] as a retriever. The\\nretrieved information is provided as input to the model for\\nresponse generation, shown to improve performance over\\nLLMs without retrieval [243], [248]. In some scenarios,\\nmultiple retrieval iterations are required to complete the task.\\nThe output generated in the first iteration is forwarded to the\\nretriever to fetch similar documents. Forward-looking active\\nretrieval (FLARE) [242] initially generates the response\\nand corrects the output by retrieving relevant documents\\nif the response contains low-confidence tokens. Similarly,\\nRepoCoder [249] fetches code snippets recursively for code\\ncompletion.\\nTraining with Retrieval Augmentation: To reduce failures in\\nretrieval augmentation generation (RAG), researchers train or\\nfine-tune retrievers and LLMs with a retrieval augmentation\\npipeline. We discuss the literature below based on their focus\\non the respective training processes of the pipeline.\\nTraining LLM: Retrieval-enhanced transformer\\n(RETRO) [238] shows pre-training smaller LLMs with\\nRAG pipeline outperforms larger LLMs, such as GPT-3\\ntrained without RAG. RETRO uses a 2-trillion token subset\\nof MassiveText as a database. The retrieval pipeline divides\\nthe input query into subsets and retrieves relevant chunks\\nfrom the database for each subset, encoded together with\\ninput intermediate representations for generating tokens. It\\nuses cross-chunked attention to attend to previous chunks\\nauto-regressively. A study on RETRO [250] shows models\\npre-trained without RAG but fine-tuned using RAG lack the\\nperformance gains obtained by pre-training with RAG.\\nTraining Retriever: Quality of responses generated by\\nLLMs is highly dependent on the in-context examples.\\nTherefore, [251], [252], [253], [254] train retrievers to\\nretrieve accurate few-shot samples while keeping the LLM\\nfrozen for generation. Retrieved samples are ranked to\\nbuild ground-truth data to train retrievers with contrastive\\nlearning in [251], [253]. RoBERTa is trained for downstream\\ntasks in [252] for ICL samples retrieval. REPLUG [254]\\ntrains the retriever with supervised signals from the frozen\\nLLM-generated outputs.\\nTraining Retriever and LLM: Further benefits are achieved\\nby training both the retriever and the model in [25], [255],\\n[256]. In this case, the error propagates back to the retriever,\\nupdating both the language model and the retriever. While\\nmasked language modeling (MLM) is a common pre-\\ntraining objective [25], [256], retrieval pre-trained transformer\\n(RPT) [255] used document chunk prediction as a pre-training\\nobjective for long text modeling.\\nEncoded Context Augmentation: Concatenating retrieved\\ndocuments with the query becomes infeasible as the sequence\\nlength and sample size grow. Encoding the context and fusing\\nit with the decoder (Fusion-in-Decoder) using cross-attention\\nFig. 13: A basic flow diagram of tool augmented LLMs. Given\\nan input and a set of available tools, the model generates a\\nplan to complete the task. The tool augmented LLMs utilize\\ndifferent modules iteratively, such as retriever, tool execution,\\nread-write to memory, feedback, etc., depending on the task.\\nmakes it possible to augment more samples without increasing\\ncomputation costs significantly [257], [238], [255], [25].\\nWeb Augmented: Locally stored memory, but external to\\nLLM, has limited information. However, a large amount of\\ninformation is available on the internet, which gets updated\\nregularly. Rather than storing information locally, various\\nmethods retrieve query-related context through a web search\\nand forward it to LLMs [258], [259], [157].\\n2. Tool Augmented LLMs: While RAG relies on the re-\\ntriever to provide context to the LLM to answer queries, tool\\naugmented LLMs capitalize on the reasoning abilities of LLMs\\nto iteratively plan by dividing tasks into sub-tasks, selecting\\nnecessary tools, and taking actions to complete the task [260],\\n[261], [262], [27]. A generic pipeline of tool-augmented LLMs\\nis shown in Figure 13, where different modules in Figure 13\\nare selected in a loop until the task completion.\\nZero-Shot Tool Augmentation: LLMs in-context learning and\\nreasoning abilities enable them to interact with tools without\\ntraining. Automatic reasoning and tool-use (ART) [262] builds\\na task library with demonstrations of reasoning steps and\\ncalling external tools. It retrieves similar task examples and\\nprovides the context to the LLM for inference. Aside from\\nthis, [263] shows tool documentation is enough to teach LLMs\\nto use tools without demonstrations. RestGPT [264] integrates\\nLLMs with RESTful APIs by decomposing tasks into planning\\nand API selection steps. The API selector understands the\\nAPI documentation to select a suitable API for the task\\nand plan the execution. ToolkenGPT [265] uses tools as\\ntokens by concatenating tool embeddings with other token\\nembeddings. During inference, the LLM generates the tool', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",

Gorilla [266] instruction-tunes LLaMA with\\ninformation retrieval from API documentation. It uses self-\\ninstruct [19] data generation pipeline with GPT-4 by providing\\nin-context examples retrieved from API documentation. Tool\\naugmented language model (TALM) [27] fine-tunes T5 [10]\\nfor tool use with a self-play approach, where it iteratively\\ncompletes tool manipulation tasks and includes them back in\\nthe training set. ToolLLM [268] collects 16k APIs from Rapi-\\ndAPI. It samples APIs from the list to generate an instruction-\\ntuning dataset using ChatGPT in single-tool and multi-tool\\nscenarios. For high-quality datasets, ToolLLM suggested a\\ndepth-first search-based decision tree (DFSDT) method to\\ngenerate ground-truths with diverse reasoning and planning.\\nMultimodal Tool Augmentation: The compositional reasoning\\ncapacity of LLMs allows them to manipulate tools in mul-\\ntimodal settings [260], [261], [269]. Following the pipeline\\nshown in Figure 13, the LLM outlines a plan, generally\\nexecuting in a sequence: Plan →Tool selection →Exe-\\ncute→Inspect →Generate, to respond to the user query.\\nHere, the database of tools is rich in modalities, including\\ntext, images, etc. Many of the multimodal tool augmentation\\nsystems employ multimodal LLMs [270], [271], [269], [261],\\nwhile others utilize single modality LLMs and generate a\\nplan on using different modality tools to solve multimodal\\nqueries [272].\\nG. Efficient LLMs\\n1. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning LLMs\\nwith tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, such as GPT-3\\n(175B), BLOOM (176B), MT-NLG (540B), etc., is hardware-\\nextensive and time-consuming. To avoid complete model fine-\\ntuning, numerous parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) [40],\\n[273], [41], [38], [39] are trying to reach full model fine-tuning\\nperformance at reduced costs. PEFT outperforms low-resource\\ntasks, achieves comparable performance on medium-resource\\ntasks, and underperforms on high-resource tasks compared\\nto full fine-tuning [274]. An overview of different PEFT\\napproaches is shown in Figure 14.\\nAdapter Tuning: Adds a few trainable parameters within the\\ntransformer block. The adapter layer is a sequence of feature\\ndownscaling, non-linearity, and upscaling [102]. Variants of\\nadapter tuning inject adapter layers sequentially [102] and\\nparallel [275], whereas the mixture of adapter (AdaMix) [276]\\nemploys multiple adapter modules in a single layer. AdaMix\\nroutes input instances randomly to one of the multiple down-\\nscale and upscale modules. The mixture of adapters is av-\\neraged out for inference to avoid additional latency. Low-\\nRank Adaptation (LoRA) [233] learns low-rank decomposed\\nmatrices to freeze original weights. Learned weights are fused\\nwith the original weights for inference, avoiding latency.\\nPrompt Tuning: Prompting is an effective way to adapt a\\npre-trained LLM for the downstream task. However, manualprompts bring uncertainty in the model’s prediction, where a\\nchange in a single word drops the performance [273]. Prompt\\ntuning alleviates this problem by fine-tuning only 0.001%-\\n3% additional parameters [277]. It concatenates trainable\\nprompt parameters with the model embeddings [273], [40],\\n[277]. Task-specific fixed discrete prompts are concatenated\\nwith input embeddings in [40]. As discrete prompts bring\\ninstability, prompts are encoded through a learnable mapping\\nin P-Tuning [273], naming continuous prompts, which are\\nappended with the discrete prompts. Only the prompt encoder\\nis trainable in the model. In an extension of P-Tuning, contin-\\nuous prompts are concatenated with each layer of the network\\nin [277]. Progressive prompts [278] avoid catastrophic forget-\\nting and transfer previously learned knowledge by sequentially\\nadding trainable prompt embeddings to the previously frozen\\ntask embeddings.\\nPrefix Tuning: A set of trainable task-specific prefix vec-\\ntors are appended to the frozen transformer layers in prefix\\ntuning [41]. The prefix vectors are virtual tokens attended\\nby the context tokens on the right. In addition, adaptive\\nprefix tuning [279] applies a gating mechanism to control the\\ninformation from the prefix and actual tokens.\\nBias Tuning: Fine-tuning only bias terms in small to medium\\ntraining data has been found effective in BitFit [280]. This\\nmethod achieves full fine-tuning performance for tasks with\\nless training data and comparable performance with larger\\ntraining data.\\n2. Quantization: LLMs require extensive computing and\\nmemory for inference. Deploying the GPT-3 175B model\\nneeds at least 5x80GB A100 GPUs and 350GB of memory\\nto store in FP16 format [281]. Such demanding requirements\\nfor deploying LLMs make it harder for smaller organizations\\nto utilize them. Model compression is an effective solution\\nbut comes at the cost of degrading performance, especially at\\nlarge scales greater than 6B. These models exhibit very large\\nmagnitude outliers that do not exist in smaller models [282],\\nmaking it challenging and requiring specialized methods for\\nquantizing LLMs [281], [283].\\nPost-Training Quantization: Minimal or no training is re-\\nquired in this quantization type without compromising the\\nmodel’s performance. LLM-8-bit [282] uses full-precision ma-\\ntrix multiplication for weights associated with outlier features\\nand 8-bit for remaining. The lower precision multiplication\\noutputs are converted to FP-16 and concatenated with others.\\nThe quantized models have homogenous word embeddings,\\ndegrading their performance. To fix this, token-level knowl-\\nedge distillation is employed in [284] along with independent\\nquantization scaling factors for each module due to varying\\nweight distribution. Feature distributions are asymmetric and\\nappear in different channels; outlier suppresion+ [285] shifts\\nand scales per-channel activation distributions for effective\\nquantization. SmoothQuant [281] quantizes activations and\\nweights to INT8 by smoothing activations and migrating the\\nquantization difficulty toward weights. It multiplies the inverse\\nof the smoothing factor with weights, which introduces a\\nfew outliers in the weights but is easier to quantify than\\nunsmoothed activations. OPTQ [283] uses the optimal brain\\ncompression (OBC) [286] algorithm to quantize the model', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

To improve speed and performance, OPTQ updates\\nweights in arbitrary order, employs lazy updates, and uses\\nbetter Cholesky kernels. Outlier-aware weight quantization\\n(OWQ) [287] uses the OPTQ algorithm for quantization but\\nassigns higher precision to vulnerable weights, causing outliers\\nand lower precision for others.\\nQuantization-Aware Training: To compensate for the per-\\nformance degradation, the quantized model is fine-tuned in\\nquantization-aware training (QAT) [288], [289], [290]. Al-\\nphatuning quantizes the model using binary coding quanti-\\nzation (BCQ) [291] and fine-tunes only quantization scaling\\nfactors. This approach improves performance over parameter-\\nefficient fine-tuning of a pre-trained model and then quan-\\ntizing and fine-tuning. Similarly, parameter-efficient and\\nquantization-aware adaptation (PEQA) [292] reduces the pre-\\ncision of fully-connected layers and fine-tunes only quantiza-\\ntion scaling parameters. LLM-QAT [290] generates training\\ndata from the pre-trained network and trains a quantized\\nstudent model with knowledge distillation. QLoRA [289] fine-\\ntunes 4-bit quantized pre-trained LLM with LoRA [233] using\\n4-bit normal float, which shows better performance over 4-bit\\ninteger and float.\\n3. Pruning: Pruning is an alternative approach to quantiza-\\ntion to compress model size, thereby reducing LLMs deploy-\\nment costs significantly. Compared to task-agnostic pruning,\\ntask-specific pruning is easily achievable with good perfor-\\nmance, where a model is fine-tuned on the downstream task\\nand pruned for faster inference. It is possible to prune LLMs\\nfor individual tasks, but the cost of pruning and deploying task-\\nspecific models is high. To overcome this, many structured and\\nunstructured pruning methods for LLMs have been proposed\\nto maintain reasonable performance while shrinking the model\\nsize [293], [294], [295].\\nUnstructured Pruning: This kind of pruning removes less\\nimportant weights without maintaining any structure. Existing\\nLLM pruning methods take advantage of the unique charac-\\nteristics of LLMs, uncommon for smaller models, where a\\nsmall subset of hidden states are activated with large magni-\\ntude [282]. Pruning by weights and activations (Wanda) [293]\\nprunes weights in every row based on importance, calculated\\nby multiplying the weights with the norm of input. Thepruned model does not require fine-tuning, saving large mod-\\nels’ computational costs. Outlier weighed layerwise sparsity\\n(OWL) [296] extends Wanda with non-uniform layer pruning.\\nIt shows that the number of outliers varies for different\\nlayers; therefore, the model should have variable pruning ratios\\nfor better performance for every layer. Contrastive pruning\\n(CAP) [297] iteratively prunes the model by training the sparse\\nmodel using contrastive loss between pre-trained, fine-tuning,\\nand snapshots of previous sparse models to learn task-specific\\nand task-agnostic knowledge.\\nStructured Pruning: Here, the parameters are removed in\\ngroups, rows, columns, or matrices, which speeds up the\\ninference because of effective NVIDIA tensor core utiliza-\\ntion [293]. LLM-Pruner [294] employs a 3-stage structured\\npruning strategy, identifying the groups of hidden states\\ncausing each other to activate during forward-pass, keeping\\nimportant groups and removing less important ones, and fine-\\ntuning the pruned model with LoRA. Sparsity-induced mask\\nlearning (SIMPLE) [298] prunes the network using learnable\\nmasks. Similarly, another method prunes LLMs by learning\\nmasks and removing unimportant rank-1 components of the\\nfactorized weight matrix [295].\\nIV. F INDINGS & INSIGHTS\\nTraining a billion-scale model is difficult as compared to\\na smaller model. LLMs are prone to various instabilities\\nduring training, such as hardware failure and instability.

In Fig. 15, we show the distribution of\\nthe existing datasets for various NLP tasks. We restrict our\\ndistribution to only the most important tasks in the literature\\nby including tasks with at least 20 datasets. LLMs can directly\\nbenefit from these datasets for training and evaluation. A\\nsummary of the training and evaluation datasets commonly\\nused by LLMs is provided next.\\nA. Training Datasets\\nThe performance of LLMs largely depends on the training\\ndata’s quality, size, and diversity. Preparing training datasets\\nof high quality at a large scale is laborious.

We summarize these efforts\\nin Table VIII. While numerous training datasets are available\\nin the literature, we cover the most widely used ones in our\\nsummary.\\nB. Evaluation Datasets and Tasks\\nThe evaluation of LLMs is important in gauging their\\nproficiency and limitations. This process measures the model’s\\nability to comprehend, generate, and interact with human\\nlanguage across a spectrum of tasks. Evaluating a language\\nmodel (LM) is divided into two broader categories: 1) natural\\nlanguage understanding (NLU) and 2) natural language gen-\\neration (NLG). It is emphasized that tasks in NLU and NLG\\nare softly categorized and are often used interchangeably in\\nthe literature.\\nNatural Language Understanding: This task measures the\\nlanguage understanding capacity of LMs. It encompasses\\nmultiple tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification,\\nnatural language inference (NLI), question answering (QA),\\ncommonsense reasoning (CR), mathematical reasoning (MR),\\nreading comprehension (RC), etc.\\nNatural Language Generation: This task assesses the language\\ngeneration capabilities of LLMs by understanding the provided\\ninput context. It includes tasks such as summarization, sen-\\ntence completion, machine translation (MT), dialogue gener-\\nation, etc.\\nNumerous datasets are proposed for each task, evaluating\\nLLMs against different characteristics. To provide an overview\\nof evaluation datasets, we briefly discuss a few famous datasets\\nwithin each category and offer a comprehensive list of datasets\\nin Table IX. Moreover, we show a detailed overview of the\\ntraining datasets and evaluation tasks and benchmarks used\\nby various pre-trained LLMs in Table X and fine-tuned LLMs\\nin Table XI.

A PPLICATIONS\\nThe application of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\\nbecome a hot topic in both AI-related research communities\\nand industries, with many emerging uses being discovered\\nand explored daily. These models, capable of understanding\\nand generating human-like text, have found meaningful ap-\\nplications across a variety of fields. This section will provide\\nan overview of LLMs’ applications in medicine, education,\\nscience, mathematics, law, finance, robotics, and coding. While\\neach of these domains poses different challenges, LLMs have\\nopportunities to make significant contributions given their\\nwide-ranging scope of applicability.General Purpose: One of the most significant applications\\nof LLMs is as a general-purpose tool for a wide variety\\nof tasks, even those that have not been specifically trained\\nfor [433]. This is due to their inherent ability to understand,\\ngenerate, and manipulate human-like text in a contextually\\nrelevant manner. This allows them to perform tasks ranging\\nfrom simple language translation and question-answering to\\nmore complex tasks like summarization, text generation, and\\neven programming help [434]. The utility of LLMs is further\\nenhanced by their ability to adapt to the specific style and tone\\nof the text they are processing, making the outputs more user-\\nfriendly and context-aware. In everyday applications, LLMs', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PREPRINT 30\\ncan be used as personal assistants, helping users draft emails\\nor schedule appointments [435]; they can also be deployed\\nin customer service to handle common questions, freeing\\nup human resources for more complex issues; or applied to\\ngenerate content for digital platforms like websites, by creating\\nhuman-like text based on given prompts [436]. Moreover,\\nLLMs play a crucial role in data analysis, where they can\\nfilter large volumes of text data, summarize key points, and\\nfind patterns that would take humans much longer time to\\nidentify [437]. Despite their wide-ranging applications, it is\\nessential to remember that LLMs, like any AI system, are only\\nas good as the data they have been trained on. We should\\nalways use LLMs carefully since they can unintentionally\\nreproduce biases in their training data, leading to potentially\\nunfair or inaccurate results.\\nMedicine: The application of LLMs in the field of medicine\\nis reshaping healthcare delivery and research. For example,\\nLLMs are increasingly used in clinical decision support sys-\\ntems to provide physicians with evidence-based treatment\\nrecommendations [438], [439], [440]. By analyzing patient\\ndata and medical literature, they can help identify potential\\ndiagnoses, suggest appropriate tests, and recommend optimal\\ntreatment strategies. Moreover, LLMs can also enhance patient\\ninteractions with healthcare systems; e.g., they can be used\\nin chatbot applications [441], [442], [443] to answer patient\\nqueries about symptoms or medications, schedule appoint-\\nments, and even provide essential health advice. For medical\\nresearch, LLMs are used to extract and filter information from\\na considerable amount of medical literature, identify relevant\\nstudies, summarize findings, and even predict future research\\ntrends [444], [445], [446]. For medical education, LLMs can\\nhelp create training materials, generate exam questions, pro-\\nvide detailed explanations of complex medical topics, and offer\\npersonalized feedback to students [447], [448], [449], [450].\\nThey can also simulate patient interactions, enabling students\\nto practice and improve their clinical skills. At a broader level,\\nLLMs can assist in public health initiatives by analyzing media\\ndata to detect disease outbreaks, monitor public sentiment\\ntowards health policies, and disseminate health information\\nin a clear and understandable manner [451]. When employing\\nLLMs to support public health initiatives, addressing related\\nissues such as data privacy, the necessity for explainability,\\nand the potential risk of propagating biases [452], [453].\\nEducation: The integration of LLMs into the educational\\nsector offers opportunities to enhance learning experiences,\\nteacher support, and educational content development. For\\nstudents, by analyzing their learning styles, performance, and\\npreferences, LLMs can provide customized study materi-\\nals and practice questions to develop personalized learning\\nexperiences [454]. For teachers, LLMs can help to create\\nlesson plans and grade assignments and generate diverse and\\ninclusive educational content, significantly saving more time\\nfor teaching and student interaction [455], [456]. In language\\nlearning, LLMs serve as advanced conversational partners\\ncapable of simulating conversations in multiple languages,\\ncorrecting grammar, enhancing vocabulary, and aiding pronun-\\nciation for the needs of fluency in practice [457]. Furthermore,\\nLLMs improve accessibility in education by providing supportfor students with disabilities. They can generate real-time\\ntranscriptions for the hearing impaired, offer reading assistance\\nfor the visually impaired, and simplify complex texts for those\\nwith learning disabilities [453]. As LLMs continue to evolve,\\ntheir applications in education can benefit more students and\\nteachers from different perspectives in practice.\\nScience: Similar to medical applications, LLMs can expedite\\nthe research process by quickly analyzing and summarizing\\nscientific literature. By briefing comprehensible and accessible\\nresearch summaries, LLMs can assist researchers in staying\\nup-to-date with the latest findings, even in fields outside\\ntheir area of expertise [458], [459]. In addition, LLMs can\\naid scientists in formulating new hypotheses and research\\nquestions since their ability to process large-scale datasets\\nallows them to unveil insights that might not be immediately\\napparent to human researchers [460]. Moreover, for scientific\\nwriting, LLMs can help researchers draft documents, suggest\\nimprovements, and ensure adherence to specific formatting\\nguidelines [461], [462]. This not only saves time but also\\nimproves the clarity of scientific communication, enabling\\ninterdisciplinary teams to work together more effectively.\\nMaths: In addition to providing mathematical research and\\neducation support, LLMs can assist in solving mathematical\\nproblems by giving step-by-step explanations and guiding\\nusers through complex proofs and calculations. They can\\nhelp identify errors in reasoning or computation and suggest\\ncorrections, serving as an invaluable tool for both learning\\nand verification purposes [463], [464]. LLMs can be employed\\nto check the validity of mathematical proofs, offering a pre-\\nliminary filter before human review. While they are not a\\nsubstitute for the meticulous work of mathematicians, they can\\nhelp simplify the process of proof verification [465], [466].\\nMoreover, LLMs enhance accessibility to mathematics by\\ntranslating complex concepts and findings into understandable\\nlanguage for non-specialists [467], where the gap between\\ntheoretical mathematics and applied contexts such as physics,\\nengineering, and economics can be bridged.\\nLaw: LLMs can assist with the thematic analysis of legal\\ndocuments, including generating initial coding for datasets,\\nidentifying themes, and classifying data according to these\\nthemes. This collaborative effort between legal experts and\\nLLMs has proved to be effective in analyzing legal texts such\\nas court opinions on theft, improving both the efficiency and\\nquality of the research [468]. Additionally, LLMs have been\\nevaluated for their ability to generate explanations of legal\\nterms, focusing on improving factual accuracy and relevance\\nby incorporating sentences from case law. By feeding relevant\\ncase law into the LLM, the augmented models can generate\\nhigher-quality explanations with less factually incorrect infor-\\nmation [469]. Moreover, LLMs can be trained with specialized\\ndomain knowledge to perform legal reasoning tasks [470] and\\nanswer legal questions [471].\\nFinance: LLMs like BloombergGPT [141], trained on ex-\\ntensive proprietary financial datasets, exhibit superior perfor-\\nmance on financial tasks. This indicates the value of domain-\\nspecific training in creating LLMs that can more accurately\\nunderstand and process industry-specific language and con-\\ncepts.

       " Document(page_content='PREPRINT 31\\nmodel offers transparent and accessible resources to develop\\nnovel applications such as robo-advising, algorithmic trading,\\nand low-code solutions, ultimately expanding the capabilities\\nof financial services. Both BloombergGPT and FinGPT show\\nthe adaptability of LLMs to the financial domain, with the\\nformer showing the power of custom datasets and the latter\\nemphasizing a data-centric approach and low-rank adaptation\\ntechniques for customization. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate an\\nability to break down complex financial tasks into actionable\\nplans, enabling end-to-end solutions that were previously\\nunfeasible with a single model [473].\\nOthers: The application of LLM in coding is introduced in\\nSection III-A2. For the utility of LLMs in robotics, please\\nrefer to Section III-D.\\nVIII. S UMMARY AND DISCUSSION\\nA. Architecture\\nDue to the gigantic scale of LLMs, minor changes in\\narchitecture and training strategies have a big impact on per-\\nformance and stability. Here, we summarize key architectural\\nmodules used in various LLMs, leading to better performance,\\nreduced training time and memory, and better training stability.\\nLayer Normalization is found to have a significant effect\\non the performance and training stability of LLMs. Pre-\\nnorm, that is normalizing inputs rather than outputs, is more\\ncommon among LLMs stabilizing the training [6], [126],\\n[104]. BLOOM [13] and AlexaTM [122] utilize an additional\\nlayer normalization before embedding layer to stabilize the\\ntraining of large-scale models, while the model’s zero-shot\\ngeneralization ability can be negatively impacted [13]. How-\\never, another study [33] finds that pre-norm degrades fine-\\ntuned model performance as compared to post-norm, and there\\nare no stability benefits of pre-norm beyond the 100B scale.\\nTherefore, GLM-130B [33] used deep-norm which is a variant\\nof post-norm for better downstream task performance after\\nfine-tuning.\\nPositional Encoding effect performance and training stability\\nof LLMs like other building blocks of a model. BLOOM [13]\\nfinds ALiBi outperforming learned and rotary positional en-\\ncodings. Contrary to this, GLM-130B [33] identifies rotary\\npositional encoding better than ALiBi. So, there is no conclu-\\nsion in literature about the positional encodings yet.\\nParallel Attention where attention and feed-forward layers are\\nparallel to each other rather than sequential in transformer\\nblock has shown to reduce training time by 15%. There is no\\nevidence of performance drop due to this change in literature\\nand used by the models PaLM [15], GPT-NeoX [115], and\\nCodeGen [130].\\nMulti-Query Attention has shared key and value attention\\nheads in a transformer block while query attention heads are\\nprojected as usual. This reduces memory usage and speeds\\nup sampling in autoregressive decoding. No performance\\ndegradation has been observed with this change and makes\\nthe training efficient allowing larger batch sizes. Multi-query\\nattention is used in [15], [132].\\nMixture of Experts allows easily scaling model to trillion\\nof parameters [129], [118]. Only a few experts are activatedduring the computation making them compute-efficient. The\\nperformance of MoE models is better than the dense models\\nfor the same amount of data and requires less computation\\nduring fine-tuning to achieve performance similar to the dense\\nmodels as discussed in [118]. MoE architectures are less\\nprone to catastrophic forgetting, therefore are more suited for\\ncontinual learning [129]. Extracting smaller sub-models for\\ndownstream tasks is possible without losing any performance,\\nmaking MoE architecture hardware-friendly [129].\\nSparse vs Dense Activated GPT-3 [6] uses sparse trans-\\nformers [63] whereas GLaM [118] and PanGu-P[129] use\\nMoE [119] architecture to lower computational costs and in-\\ncrease the model size and capacity. According to the literature,\\nsparse modules do not degrade the model’s performance [63].\\nHowever, more experiments are required to verify this state-\\nment.\\nB. Training Strategies\\nTraining models at a huge scale require some tricks to\\nreduce training costs, avoid loss divergence and achieve better\\nperformance. We summarize and discuss some of these key\\ntricks used in different LLMs.\\nMixed Precision is a famous method for LLMs to reduce\\nmemory usage and improve training efficiency. In mixed\\nprecision, forward and backward passes are performed in\\nFP16 format whereas optimizer states and master weights are\\nkept in FP32 format [474]. A drawback associated with this\\nformat change is training instability due to a smaller value\\nrange resulting in loss spikes [33]. An alternative to FP16\\nis BF16 which has a comparatively larger range and performs\\nsome precision-sensitive operations like gradient accumulation\\nand softmax in FP32 [13]. BF16 has better performance and\\ntraining stability but uses more memory and is supported on\\nspecific hardware, for example, A100 GPUs. Therefore, its\\nadoption in LLMs is limited.\\nTraining Instability is a common issue in LLMs where loss\\ndivergence or spiking is observed multiple times during train-\\ning. This happens in the presence of gradient clipping [15].\\nTo mitigate this problem, many approaches suggest restarting\\ntraining from an earlier checkpoint [15], [33], [118], skipping\\n200-500 earlier data batches at the point of divergence in [15]\\nand re-shuffling batches in [118]. The embedding layer gradi-\\nent shrink proves to further stabilize the training as its gradient\\nnorm is significantly larger than the other layers [33]. Another\\nsuggestion to improve training stability for larger models is not\\nto use biases in dense and norm layers as in [15].\\nWeight Initialization plays a significant role in model con-\\nvergence and training stability. GPT-NeoX [115] initializes\\nfeed-forward layers before residuals with2\\nL√\\ndas in [144] and\\nother layers with small initialization scheme [475]. This avoids\\nactivations growing exponentially with the increasing depth.\\nMT-NLG [114] found higher variance for weight initialization\\nleads to unstable training, hence validating small initialization\\nscheme [475]. Various models perform random weight ini-\\ntialization which can cause bad initialization, Galactica [138]\\nsuggests a longer warmup to negate the effect.\\nLearning Rate is important for stable training. It is suggested', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 30}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PREPRINT 32\\nto use a lower value [13], [15], [124] with warmup and decay\\n(cosine or linear). Usually, the learning rate is within the\\nrange 1e−4to8e−4. Moreover, MT-NLG (530B) [114] and\\nGPT-NeoX (20B) [115] suggest interpolating learning rates\\nbased on the model size using the GPT-3 [6] models ranging\\nbetween 13B and 175B. This avoids tuning the learning rate\\nhyperparameter.\\nTraining Parallelism 3D parallelism, a combination of data,\\npipeline and tensor parallelism, is the most utilized training\\nparallelism approach in LLMs [33], [15], [14], [13], [114],\\n[112], [109]. In addition to the 3D parallelism, BLOOM [13]\\nuses zero optimizer [37] to shard optimizer states. PanGu-\\nα[104] and PanGu- Σ[129] go beyond the 3D parallelism and\\napply 5D parallelism which additionally contains optimizer\\nparallelism and rematerialization.\\nMode Switching adds task-related tokens at the beginning\\nof the text during training. These tokens refer to the natural\\nlanguage understanding and natural language generation tasks\\nwhich are shown to improve the downstream task performance\\nin [89], [124], [122]. During fine-tuning and inference, tokens\\nare appended based on the downstream tasks.\\nControllable Text Generation Generating credible and con-\\ntrolled text from a pre-trained model is challenging. GPT-\\n3 [6] and other LLMs use in-context learning to control\\ngenerated text. While in-context learning helps in controlling\\nthe generated text, ERNIE 3.0 Titan [35] suggests using\\nadversarial loss to rank its generated text for credibility and\\nsoft prompts such as genre, topic, keywords, sentiment, and\\nlength for better control on generated text.\\nC. Pre-Training vs Instruction Tuning\\nWhile pre-training is important for the generalization of\\nLLMs, instruction-tuning improves the performance of LLMs\\nfurther and makes them useable. Therefore, it is suggested\\nto perform instruction fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs to use\\nthem effectively [16], [18], [20], [93], [157].\\nD. Supervised Models vs Generalized Models\\nAlthough generalized models are capable of performing\\ndiverse tasks with good performance they have not yet outper-\\nformed models trained in supervised settings. The supervised\\ntrained models are still state-of-the-art in various NLP tasks\\nby a large margin as shown in [6], [15], [18].\\nE. Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot\\nLLMs perform well in zero-shot and few-shot settings. But\\nthe performance difference between zero-shot and few-shot\\nis large for pre-trained models [6], [15], naming LLMs as\\nmeta-learners [6]. LLMs zero-shot evaluations underperform\\nunsupervised methods in neural machine translation [6]. The\\nliterature shows pre-training is not enough for good zero-\\nshot performance [15], [16]. To improve the zero-shot per-\\nformance the literature suggests using instruction fine-tuning\\nthat improves the zero-shot performance significantly and\\noutperforms baselines. Instruction fine-tuning has also been\\nshown to improve zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.\\nAnother model Flan-PaLM [16] unlocks zero-shot reasoning\\nwith CoT training.F . Encoder vs Decoder vs Encoder-Decoder\\nTraditionally, these architectures perform well for different\\ntasks, for example, encoder-only for NLU tasks, decoder-\\nonly for NLG, and encoder-decoder for sequence2sequence\\nmodeling. Encoder-only models are famous for smaller models\\nsuch as Bert [7], RoBERTa [424], etc, whereas LLMs are\\neither decoder-only [6], [115], [13] or encoder-decoder [10],\\n[11], [122]. While decoder-only models are good at NLG\\ntasks, various LLMs, PaLM [15], OPT [14], GPT-3 [6],\\nBLOOM [13], LLaMA [147], are decoder-only models with\\nsignificant performance gains on both NLU and NLG tasks. In\\ncontradiction to this, T5 [10] and UL2 [89] identify encoder-\\ndecoder models out-performing decoder-only models. In an-\\nother study, PaLM [15] finds increasing the size of decoder-\\nonly models can reduce the performance gap between decoder-\\nonly and encoder-decoder architectures.\\nAlthough decoder-only architectures have become a trend for\\nLLMs, many recently proposed approaches [89], [122] use\\nmode-switching tokens in text with encoder-decoder architec-\\ntures to enable task-specific modes. Similarly, CodeT5+ [34]\\nuses an encoder-decoder architecture with multiple training\\nobjectives for different tasks, activating the encoder, decoder,\\nor both according to the tasks. These variations in architecture\\nand training objectives allow a model to perform well in differ-\\nent settings. Because of this dynamic configuration, the future\\nof LLMs can be attributed to encoder-decoder architectures.\\nIX. C HALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\\nLLMs such as GPT-4 and its predecessors have significantly\\nadvanced natural language processing. Nevertheless, they also\\nbring along a set of challenges. The computational cost, adver-\\nsarial robustness, and interpretability are among the technical\\nchallenges that are intrinsic to these models. Furthermore, as\\nthese models are scaled up to handle more complex tasks\\nor to operate in more complex or dynamic environments,\\nnew challenges in scalability, privacy, and real-time processing\\nemerge. On the frontier of foundational research, integrating\\nmulti-modality and the effectiveness of transfer learning are\\nbeing keenly explored. Additionally, the continuous learning\\naspect of these models, which aims to have models that can\\nadapt to new information over time, presents a fresh set of\\nchallenges. These challenges not only underscore the technical\\nintricacies involved but also highlight the broader impact and\\nthe future trajectory of LLMs in real-world applications. The\\nfollowing sections delve into these challenges, shedding light\\non the ongoing and potential efforts to address them.\\nComputational Cost: Training LLMs requires extensive com-\\nputational resources, which increases production costs and\\nraises environmental concerns due to substantial energy con-\\nsumption during large-scale training. Improved performance\\noccurs as computational resources increase, but the rate of\\nimprovement gradually decreases when both the model and\\ndataset size remain fixed, following the power law of dimin-\\nishing returns [476].\\nBias and Fairness: LLMs can inherit and amplify societal\\nbiases in their training data. These biases can manifest in\\nthe model’s outputs, leading to potential ethical and fairness', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PREPRINT 33\\nissues [477].\\nOverfitting: Although LLMs possess substantial learning ca-\\npabilities, they are susceptible to overfitting noisy and peculiar\\npatterns within their extensive training data. Consequently,\\nthis may cause them to generate illogical responses [478].\\nThe debate about Memorization vs. Generalization in LLMs\\nis about finding the right balance. Memorization allows the\\nmodel to remember specific details from its training data,\\nensuring it can provide accurate answers to precise questions.\\nHowever, generalization enables the model to make inferences\\nand produce responses for inputs it hasn’t seen before, which\\nis essential for handling various real-world tasks. Striking the\\nright balance is the challenge: too much memorization can\\nlead to overfitting, making the model inflexible and struggling\\nwith new inputs [479].\\nEconomic and Research Inequality: The high cost of training\\nand deploying LLMs may make their development concen-\\ntrated within well-funded organizations, potentially worsening\\neconomic and research inequalities in AI [480].\\nReasoning and Planning: Some reasoning and planning tasks,\\neven as seemingly simple as common-sense planning, which\\nhumans find easy, remain well beyond the current capabilities\\nof LLMs evaluated using an assessment framework. This\\nisn’t entirely unexpected, considering that LLMs primarily\\ngenerate text completions based on likelihood and offer no\\nsolid guarantees in terms of reasoning abilities [481].\\nHallucinations: LLMs exhibit \"hallucinations,\" where they\\ngenerate responses that, while sounding plausible, are incorrect\\nor don’t align with the provided information [482]. The\\nhallucination can be categorized into three categories.\\n•Input-conflicting hallucination, wherein LLMs produce\\ncontent that diverges from the input given by users.\\n•Context-conflicting hallucination, where LLMs generate\\ncontent that contradicts information they have generated\\nearlier.\\n•Fact-conflicting hallucination involves LLM’s generation\\nof content that does not align with established world\\nknowledge.\\nPrompt Engineering: Prompts serve as inputs to LLMs, and\\ntheir syntax and semantics play a crucial role in determining\\nthe model’s output. The prompt variations, sometimes counter-\\nintuitive to humans, can result in significant changes in model\\noutput and are addressed through prompt engineering, which\\ninvolves designing natural language queries to guide LLMs\\nresponses effectively [483], [32].\\nLimited Knowledge: Information acquired during pretraining\\nis limited and may become obsolete after some time. Re-\\ntraining the model using updated data is costly. To generate\\nfactually accurate responses people use retrieval augmentation\\npipeline [243]. However, pre-trained models are not trained\\nwith retrieval augmentation generation (RAG) [6], [21],\\nhence, adapting the training pipeline is necessary [238], [25].\\nSafety and Controllability: Using LLMs comes with the risk\\nof generating harmful, misleading, or inappropriate content,\\nwhether by accident or when given specific prompts. Ensuring\\nthese models are safely utilized is a significant concern [484].\\nMulti-Modality: Multi-modal learning, where LLMs aretrained on diverse data like text, images, and videos, aims to\\ncreate models with richer understanding but faces challenges\\nin data alignment, fusion strategies, and higher computational\\ndemands.\\nCatastrophic Forgetting: LLMs are often pre-trained on large\\ndatasets and then fine-tuned on domain-specific data, reducing\\ntraining resources but facing issues like domain adaptation\\nand catastrophic forgetting, which hinders the retention of\\noriginal knowledge when learning new tasks.\\nAdversarial Robustness: Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nhave shown great capabilities in various tasks but are\\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight, deliberate\\ninput alterations can mislead them. Especially with models\\nlike BERT, adversarial fine-tuning can enhance robustness,\\nalthough it sometimes compromises generalization [485].\\nAs LLMs integrate more into complex systems, examining\\ntheir security properties becomes crucial, given the emerging\\nfield of adversarial attacks on LLMs within trustworthy\\nML [486]. This vulnerability is notable in safety-critical\\ndomains, necessitating robust adversarial evaluation tools to\\nensure LLM reliability [487].\\nInterpretability and Explainability: The \"black-box\" nature\\nof LLMs poses challenges in understanding their decision-\\nmaking, which is crucial for broader acceptance and trust,\\nespecially in sensitive domains. Despite their advanced\\ncapabilities, the lack of insight into their operation limits\\ntheir effectiveness and trustworthiness [488], [489]. Efforts\\nare being made to make LLMs more explainable to promote\\nuser trust and to ensure responsible AI usage. Understanding\\nthe logic behind LLMs’ responses is essential for fostering\\ntrust and ensuring they align with human values and legal\\nstandards.\\nPrivacy Concerns: Privacy concerns in Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) have escalated with their growth in\\ncomplexity and size, particularly around data sharing and\\npotential misuse. There is a risk of malicious content\\ncreation, filter bypass, and data privacy issues, especially in\\ne-commerce, where protecting customer privacy is crucial. If\\nmodels are trained on private data, additional concerns arise\\nif such models are made publicly available. LLMs tend to\\nmemorize phrases from their training sets, which an adversary\\ncould exploit to extract sensitive data, posing a threat to\\npersonal privacy [490], [491].\\nReal-Time Processing: Real-time processing in Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) is pivotal for various applications,\\nespecially with the rising popularity of mobile AI applications\\nand concerns regarding information security and privacy.\\nHowever, LLMs often have hundreds of layers and millions\\nof parameters, which impede real-time processing due to\\nthe high computational demands and limited weight storage\\non hardware platforms, particularly in edge computing\\nenvironments [492]. While certain efforts like MobileBERT\\naim to reduce memory requirements, they still face substantial\\nexecution overhead due to the large number of model layers,\\nleading to high inference latency.\\nLong-Term Dependencies: Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nhave shown considerable progress in understanding and\\ngenerating text, yet they often struggle with preserving', metadata={'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PREPRINT 34\\ncontext and handling long-term dependencies, particularly in\\ncomplex, multi-turn conversations or long documents. This\\nlimitation can lead to incoherent or irrelevant responses.\\nHardware Acceleration: The growth of LLMs presents\\nsignificant hardware challenges due to the increasing\\ncomputational and memory demands associated with training\\nand deploying these models. GPUs have played a crucial role\\nin meeting the hardware requirements for training LLMs,\\nwith the networking industry also evolving to optimize\\nhardware for training workloads. However, the growing size\\nof LLMs, which has been outpacing hardware progress, makes\\nmodel inference increasingly costly. Model quantization is\\na promising approach to bridge the widening gap between\\nLLM size and hardware capacity [493]. Although specialized\\nhardware acceleration like GPUs or TPUs can significantly\\nreduce the computational cost, making real-time applications\\nmore feasible, they may not fully resolve all limitations,\\nnecessitating further advancements in hardware technology.\\nRegulatory and Ethical Frameworks: The rapid\\nadvancements in artificial intelligence have given rise to\\nsophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s\\nGPT-4 [148] and Google’s Bard. These developments\\nunderscore the imperative for regulatory oversight to manage\\nthe ethical and social challenges accompanying LLMs’\\nwidespread use [494]. For instance, LLMs can generate\\ncontent that can be used positively or negatively, emphasizing\\nthe need for proactive ethical frameworks and policy measures\\nto guide their responsible use and assign accountability for\\ntheir outputs [495]. Auditing is identified as a promising\\ngovernance mechanism to ensure that AI systems, including\\nLLMs, are designed and deployed ethically, legally, and\\ntechnically robust [496].\\nX.

Relative: To pass the information on the relative depen-\\ndencies of different tokens appearing at different locations in\\nthe sequence, a relative positional encoding is calculated by\\nsome kind of learning. Two famous types of relative encodings\\nare:\\nAlibi: [65] In this approach, a scalar bias is subtracted from\\nthe attention score calculated using two tokens which increases\\nwith the distance between the positions of the tokens. This\\nlearned approach effectively favors using recent tokens for\\nattention.\\nRoPE: Keys, queries, and values are all vectors in the LLMs.\\nRoPE [66] involves the rotation of the query and key represen-\\ntations at an angle proportional to their absolute positions of\\nthe tokens in the input sequence. This step results in a relative\\npositional encoding scheme which decays with the distance\\nbetween the tokens.\\nE. Activation Functions\\nThe activation functions serve a crucial role in the curve-\\nfitting abilities of the neural networks, as proved in [68]. The\\nmodern activation functions used in LLMs are different from\\nthe earlier squashing functions but are critical to the success\\nof LLMs. We discuss these activation functions in this section.\\n1. ReLU [69]: Rectified linear unit (ReLU) is defined as\\nReLU (x) =max(0, x) (1)\\n2. GeLU [70]: Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GeLU) is the\\ncombination of ReLU, dropout [71] and zoneout [72]. It is the\\nmost widely used activation function in contemporary LLM\\nliterature.\\n3. GLU variants [73]: Gated Linear Unit [74] is a neural\\nnetwork layer that is an element-wise product ( ⊗) of a linear\\ntransformation and a sigmoid transformed ( σ) linear projection\\nof the input given as\\nGLU (x, W, V, b, c ) = (xW+b)⊗σ(xV+c), (2)\\nwhere Xis the input of layer and l,W, b, V andcare learned\\nparameters.\\nGLU was modified in [73] to evaluate the effect of different\\nvariations in the training and testing of transformers, resulting\\nin better empirical results.

General Purpose:\\n1.1 T5 [10]: An encoder-decoder model employing a\\nunified text-to-text training for all NLP problems, shown in\\nFigure 7. T5 places layer normalization outside the residual\\npath in a conventional transformer model [62]. It uses masked\\nlanguage modeling as a pre-training objective where spans\\n(consecutive tokens) are replaced with a single mask instead of\\nseparate masks for each token. This type of masking speeds\\nup the training as it produces shorter sequences. After pre-\\ntraining, the model is fine-tuned using adapter layers [102]\\nfor downstream tasks.\\n1.2 GPT-3 [6]: The GPT-3 architecture is same as the\\nGPT-2 [5] but with dense and sparse attention in transformer\\nlayers similar to the Sparse Transformer [63]. It shows that\\nlarge models can train on larger batch sizes with a lower\\nlearning rate; in order to decide the batch size during training,\\nGPT-3 uses the gradient noise scale as in [103]. Overall,\\nGPT-3 increases model parameters to 175B showing that the\\nperformance of large language models improves with the scale\\nand is competitive with the fine-tuned models.\\n1.3 mT5 [11]: A multilingual T5 model [10] trained on\\nthe mC4 dataset with 101 languages.

Opposite to GPT-3, which uses dense and sparse\\nlayers, GPT-NeoX-20B uses only dense layers. The hyperpa-\\nrameter tuning at this scale is difficult; therefore, the model\\nchooses hyperparameters from the method [6] and interpolates', metadata={'page': 8.0, 'source': 'R:\\\\Projects\\\\Langchain\\\\llmsurvey\\\\LLM Survey.pdf'})]"

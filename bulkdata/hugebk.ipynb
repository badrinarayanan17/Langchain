Lopez was struggli ng to decide which segment (or segments) to \\ntarget and how to position VAIO for this segment. \\nAt the heart of his struggle was an unusual problem—too much data. When Lopez started \\ndrafting his plan he was referencing three market  research reports: a study on consumer values, \\nqualitative interview data, and a segmentation study completed just two months earlier. Then in \\nDecember Sony’s vice president of global marke ting had encouraged all product managers to \\nutilize a new corporate study that segmented cons umers at a global level.  Lopez wondered which \\nstudy—or combination of studies—would lead  to the best plan for VAIO in China. \\nAbout Sony Corporation and VAIO \\nSony Corporation began in 1946 as the Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, \\na manufacturer of telecommunications and measurement equipment. Over the following decades, Sony (the company’s official name as of 1958) became a major player in multiple electronics \\nmarkets, including audio, video, communications , and information technology products for home \\nand professional use. By 2010 the company’s motion picture, television, computer entertainment, music, and online businesses were operated by  more than 171,000 employees worldwide, \\nincluding in Japan, the United States, Europe, a nd China. Sony recorded consolidated annual \\nsales of approximately $89 billion for th e fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. \\nTo build on its consumer lines (which include d past category leaders such as the Walkman \\npersonal stereo and current leaders such as the Handycam camcorder), Sony introduced what \\nbecame the VAIO series of computer products in mid-1996, with the debut of a desktop product. One year later the company released VAIO laptops in Japan. \\nSony’s strategy for the VAIO laptop was to offer a relatively high-end niche product that \\nattracted consumers for whom style and design we re a top priority. Prior to the VAIO launch, \\ncompetitor laptops tended to feature fairly simila r and relatively unexciting designs. Most laptops \\nwere available only in monochromatic grays and blacks, and they tended to be boxy, bulky, and \\nheavy.

       " Document(page_content='SONY TARGETS LAPTOP CONSUMERS IN CHINA  5-311-500 \\n2 KELLOGG SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT  Against this competitive backdrop, the VA IO 505 line, which launched in 1998, was a \\nrevolutionary offering that garnered significan t awareness and recognition. The 505 was designed \\nto be visibly distinguishable from every other brand and model on the market, and was therefore \\npositioned as a “statement computer.” The business press frequently referred to VAIO’s design as “sleek,” and for the first production run it was ava ilable in different colors—the most iconic of \\nwhich was a rich purple hue. The 505 was particularly popular with image-conscious businesspeople who cared about what their computer said about them. As a result, the VAIO brand established strong associations with the a ttributes of “style” and “design,” a brand image \\nthat Sony continued to foster in subsequent years by emphasizing design cues and reducing laptop weight and size. \\nThroughout much of the 2000s, VAIO also distinguished itself via its software. In those days, \\nconsumers invariably purchased software (rather than getting it free on the Internet or licensing \\nvia cloud computing). Manufacturers either sold stripped computers that consumers needed to load up with purchased software or fully loaded computers that came with a suite of software \\nofferings. VAIO sold computers with software  already loaded, and one of its distinctive \\nadvantages was the multimedia software (suc h as video editing, photo editing, and music \\nsoftware) that came with the hardware, wh ich competitors were not as likely to have. \\nRather than pitch the product to a mass audi ence, Sony established and maintained a position \\nfor VAIO as a premium offering. Regardless of m odel, compared to competitors’ equivalents, \\nVAIO almost always had the higher average selling price (ASP). Although the higher price \\nreinforced VAIO’s premium image, it also strengt hened consumer associations between the brand \\nand high price and kept Sony from attracting a mass audience like many of its competitors did. \\nWith VAIO, Sony focused almost exclusively on laptop production, marketing, and sales. In \\nthe early years of VAIO, this was an uncommon focus for a computer brand because laptop penetration relative to desktops was relatively lo w. Initially, this limited VAIO sales but it also \\ngave the company an opportunity to gain a toe hold in laptops, which began to outstrip desktop \\nsales in the late 2000s. \\nIn part because it was marketed as a statemen t computer, VAIO was largely seen by buyers as \\na computer for individual consumers and business pr ofessionals rather than as an enterprise brand \\nfor large or medium-sized businesses. Generally sp eaking, IT managers tended to resist paying \\nextra for machines based on aesthetic design c onsiderations and instead focused more on \\nfunctional benefits. A further complication was that many businesses offered their employees laptops with a standardized suite of software  programs, which did not typically include the \\nprograms normally offered as part of the VAIO p ackage. This meant that IT managers who \\npurchased VAIO often had to strip these programs from the laptop before distributing them to employees. \\nVAIO’s commitment to a premium position extend ed to China, where it enjoyed moderate \\nsuccess. (See Exhibit 1  for screenshots from the Sony website .) Copycats and counterfeits were \\nalso successful in the Chinese computer and software market, but VAIO was particularly \\nattractive to a segment of consumers who placed a high value on not just functional attributes but also more intangible benefits. VAIO’s re cognized and unwavering position as a statement \\ncomputer gave it an advantage among these consumer s, and this advantage was reinforced by the \\ngenerally high regard that Chinese consumer s had for Japanese electronics brands. Knockoff \\nproducts sold in China could duplicate some or many  of the technical characteristics of VAIO but \\nwere less successful imitating its branding and aest hetics. Furthermore, many Chinese consumers ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\USER\\\\Downloads\\\\CASE _1.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='5-311-500 S ONY TARGETS LAPTOP CONSUMERS IN CHINA  \\nKELLOGG SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT  3 who valued intangible benefits such as status  or peace of mind showed a preference for \\npurchasing the genuine brand even if a copycat accurately mimicked it. \\nMarket Research on the Chinese Laptop Consumer \\nTo help inform his decision, Lopez had the results  of four separate market research efforts: a \\nlarge-scale study of the Chinese laptop consumer, a more detailed report consisting of interviews \\nwith Chinese laptop consumers, and two segmentation studies that provided different pictures of \\nthe Chinese laptop consumer market. \\nThe Shanghai Report: A Broad Pictur e of the Chinese Laptop Consumer \\nIn early 2010, with the help of a market resear ch firm, Sony conducted research in Shanghai \\nto gain a deeper understanding of the modern Ch inese consumer’s values, consumption behavior, \\nand usage habits, including for laptop computers such as VAIO. \\nThe Shanghai Report identified three key trends that were a consequence of the country’s \\n“bullet-train economy,” which had sped through th e industrial, computer, and Internet ages in \\nonly three decades. First, major education a nd income gaps among segments of China’s \\npopulation had created a significant sense of inequality among Chinese consumers. Second, \\nChina was awash in low-quality and/or knockoff products, as well as free (and often pirated) online content such as movies, MP3s, and soft ware. These products ge nerated differing—and \\nsometimes opposing—reactions from different consumer segments. Some believed that \\npurchasing these products was the sign of a shrewd  buyer; others believed that knockoff or \\npirated products were significantly poorer in quality than genuine products; and others had \\nopinions that varied depending on the product and the category. Lastly, and partly as a consequence of the first two trends, a growing segment of Chinese consumers aspired to enjoy \\nlevels of status, money, technol ogy, and knowledge similar to t hose of more developed nations, \\nboth to enjoy a better quality of life as well as to  distinguish themselves from other (usually less \\naffluent) consumers who were stuck in the China of past decades. \\nThis trend toward status-seeking motivated a significant minority of Chinese consumers to \\nfavor foreign and/or high-end bra nds based on their promise of quality in a market saturated with \\ncopycat brands and unethical businesses. Chinese citizens were “detail-oriented consumers” who \\nsought comprehensive information about brands , products, and models  before making purchase \\ndecisions. \\nThe Shanghai Report also noted that China’s post-1980s generation represented \\napproximately 50 percent of the country’s wo rking-age population; this cohort was better \\neducated than previous generations and drove mu ch of the status-seeking behavior observed in \\nthe country. In general, these consumers were most  interested in purchasing cars, computers, and \\nhouses.  \\nThe report provided penetration and demographic data for Chinese laptop and desktop users \\nbased on a representative survey of consumers in that country (see Exhibits 2 and 3). It also \\nprovided information on Sony’s market share in China (see Exhibit 4 ). ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\USER\\\\Downloads\\\\CASE _1.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='SONY TARGETS LAPTOP CONSUMERS IN CHINA  5-311-500 \\n4 KELLOGG SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT  Customer Interviews: A Deeper Understanding of Chinese Laptop Users \\nTo understand laptop-related pe rceptions and preferences in more detail, Sony conducted in-\\ndepth interviews with forty Chinese VAIO lapt op owners and four pe ople who owned non-Sony \\nlaptops. The interviewees were between 21 a nd 35 years old (representing the average age of \\nChinese laptop owners) and included students, pa rents, and professionals. Interviewees were \\nasked about how they researched, shopped for, set up, and used their laptops, along with their general perceptions of laptop co mputer brands. As a group, the interviews revealed three key \\nthemes related to laptop purchases and use: \\nBRANDS ARE AN EXTENSION OF WHO I AM \\nEven more than consumers in North America and Europe, Chinese consumers saw electronics \\npurchases as a strong means of self-expression. Consumers bought the right products to gain the approval or acceptance of friends, to show a good “f ace” to society, to stand out, or simply to \\nshow off. When interviewers delved more deep ly into the question of how a laptop brand might \\nbe an extension of who they are, three main id entities emerged. In China, laptops could be an \\nextension of a consumer’s identity as a “multime dia person,” a “tech person,” or a “cool person.” \\nIn general, owning a laptop was considered a sign of status. Although respondents easily \\nrecognized the Sony brand and considered it to  be a premium label, they were generally \\nunfamiliar with or indifferent to the VAIO bra nd, which they usually referred to as the “Sony \\nlaptop.” The Sony brand was seen as “young and trendy,” partly due to the number of color \\nchoices the company offered for its products. Am ong other top-selling brands in China, Apple \\nwas viewed as “cool,” ThinkPad as “trustworthy,” and Asus as “mainstream and bland.” Consumers also valued a brand’s history in Ch ina. For example, Lenovo was viewed favorably \\nbecause it was seen as the most established PC bra nd in China and therefore had heritage there. \\nMost respondents saw Sony as an early player in the Chinese market. \\nASKING FOR PRODUCT ADVICE IS ONE WAY I CONNECT WITH OTHERS \\nRespondents highlighted the importance of their rol es in society, especially in relation to their \\nimmediate and extended family. Their emphasis on networks in general was much greater than that observed in North America and Western Eur ope. As a result, word of mouth (Internet or \\notherwise) was viewed as an essential part of the buying process. Consumers sought knowledge \\nand advice—including information related to bra nds—from family, friends , and others before \\nmaking purchase decisions. This behavior also reflected Chinese consumers’ tendency to follow \\ntrends. \\nJUST GIVE ME WHAT I WANT \\nInterviewees noted that the electronics ma rket often confused them by providing \\n“meaningless information” and too many mode ls that differed only on minor specifications. \\nGiven its rapid growth, the Chinese market had made consumers more receptive to new \\ntechnologies and products. Nonetheless, respondents tended to delete or disable their laptops’ \\nnative applications, which were often viewed as me rely marketing ploys. Different features were \\nmore important to different interviewees, de pending on how they used their laptops. More \\nspecifically: \\n1. Some consumers depended on their laptops prim arily to connect with others via e-mail, \\nsocial networking sites, blogging, VOIP, and so on.

Others viewed their computers as being primarily a productivity tool—something that \\nhelped them be successful at school or work. \\n3. Still others were relatively light users who relied on their computers for everyday tasks \\nand who were easily confused by extra features. \\n4. Finally, several interviewees depended on their la ptops to be the key integrators of all the \\ntechnologies they owned and used—from their televisions and cell phones to their online \\nsocial networking. This included an emer ging segment of consumers who used their \\ncomputers as central hubs for accessing a nd experiencing multimedia—everything from \\ntelevision shows and movies to computer games and social media. \\nThe CLUES Report \\nThe interview data provided some rich insights about consumer use, but Lopez felt he needed \\nmore segmentation information to support his recommendations. What were the key similarities \\nand differences among consumers in China, and we re there different groups of consumers in \\nChina with different product preferences? How big (or small) were these groups, and what market \\nopportunities did they present? \\nIn early 2010, after nearly a year of negotia tion with top management, Lopez gained approval \\nto conduct research on the Chinese laptop market —a project he called the Chinese Laptop User \\nSurvey, or CLUES. Lopez’s team and an outsid e market research firm conducted 760 surveys \\n(face-to-face or by video conference) of Chinese consumers between 18 and 55 years of age. All participants either owned a laptop or were inter ested in purchasing one in the near future. Among \\nother questions, CLUES respondents were asked to rate laptops on specific characteristics (e.g., \\ncoolness, simplicity, productivity). These questi ons were based on the qualitative data collected \\nfrom the interviews. \\nA statistical analysis of the CLUES data yielded six Chinese laptop user segments: \\n\\uf0b7 Entertainment Lover \\n\\uf0b7 Business Focused \\n\\uf0b7 Family User \\n\\uf0b7 Tech Enthusiast \\n\\uf0b7 Fashion Oriented \\n\\uf0b7 Heavy User \\nExhibit 5  presents descriptions of the CLUES segments, along with the percentage of the \\ntotal sample each represented and its rating profile  on seven characteristics laptops represented. In \\nthese segments, Lopez saw some evidence of th e insights gleaned from the qualitative interview \\ndata.

       " Document(page_content='SONY TARGETS LAPTOP CONSUMERS IN CHINA  5-311-500 \\n6 KELLOGG SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT  Project Compass  \\nIn June 2008 Sony began undertaking an unpr ecedented cross-compan y and cross-regional \\nsegmentation to enhance the company’s understandi ng of consumers globally. The study, known \\nas Project Compass, was intended to provide the mo st comprehensive view of consumers across a \\nvariety of markets, business groups, and product categories. The process of conceptualizing, \\nfunding, designing, and implementing Compass took more than two years, partly because of the immense challenges associated with launching an d managing a truly global research effort. \\nBefore Compass, all of Sony’s segmentation efforts were region-specific, product-specific, or \\na combination of both. For instance, one study segmented television consumers in Western and \\nEastern Europe. Another segmented digital-camera  enthusiasts in Latin America. Still another \\nsegmented computer users in Asia. Looking at  all of these studies commissioned annually, \\nmanagers at Sony corporate began to wonder: Aren ’t digital camera users in Latin America likely \\nto be similar to digital camera users in Asia ? If they are, shouldn’t insights from the Latin \\nAmerican camera market be translated to other markets? Sony managers also began to speculate \\nthat the segmentation results for at least some different product categories were likely to be similar. For instance, shouldn’t a study that segments buyers of Blu-ray Disc\\nTM players reveal \\ninformation similar to that produced by a segmentation study of high-end television buyers? \\nProject Compass was a massive worldwide segmentation study that included data from more \\nthan 30,000 respondents. It represented a move to  better align cross-divisional and cross-regional \\nthinking regarding consumer segments while still allowing local regions and different product \\ngroups to customize marketing efforts. Sony hoped that Project Compass would help product managers and others build “cross-category clus ter value” by focusing on the same consumer \\ntarget. Project Compass data w as collected from 4,000 participants from each of eight countries: \\nJapan, the United States, Canada, the UK, France,  Germany, China, and Russia. Researchers \\nconducted face-to-face or Internet-based interv iews seeking quantitative data and led focus \\ngroups to capture qualitative information. All par ticipants were between 16 and 65 years of age \\nand had to either use or be interested in on e of the following products: television, computer, \\ndigital camera, DVD player, or personal/home audio system. \\nA statistical analysis of the Compass data yielded six global consumer segments: \\n\\uf0b7 Technosocializers \\n\\uf0b7 Performance Seekers \\n\\uf0b7 Status Focused \\n\\uf0b7 Unfussy Basics \\n\\uf0b7 Functional Socializers \\n\\uf0b7 Quality of Lifers \\nExhibit 6 describes each of these segments; Exhibit 7  reports how the segments were \\nrepresented in each of the countries studied; and Exhibit 8  reports the likely interest of each \\nsegment in computer purchasing and the Sony brand. \\nUpon reviewing the Compass data, Lopez noticed  that segments in some countries were \\nparticularly large. For example, 33 percent of Japanese consumers were categorized as ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\USER\\\\Downloads\\\\CASE _1.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='5-311-500 S ONY TARGETS LAPTOP CONSUMERS IN CHINA  \\nKELLOGG SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT  7 Technosocializers, and 31 percent of Russian c onsumers were categorized as Status Focused. \\nRecognizing that goal of segmentation models is to divide consumers into addressable subgroups, \\nthese large segments gave Lopez some concern a bout the validity and reliability of the Compass \\napproach, both in general and as applied to Ch ina. However, after consulting with the market \\nresearch firm responsible for Compass, and afte r reviewing the data more carefully, he was \\nreassured that, at the present time, some countries did have very large segments of consumers with relatively homogeneous cons umer electronics preferences. \\nComparing CLUES and Compass \\nTo gain a more complete picture of the mark et information, Lopez asked his Chinese market \\nresearch firm to re-contact the 760 consumers w ho originally responded to the CLUES study and \\nto ask them a series of questions that allowed them to be categorized according to the Project \\nCompass segments. Partly because Lopez offere d these consumers a financial incentive to \\nrespond a second time, the response rate was rather high: His market research firm was able to \\ngain additional responses from nearly 600 (78 pe rcent) of the original consumers, with no \\nindication that the response rate was biased in fa vor of a particular CLUES or Compass segment. \\nThis additional data collection allowed Lopez a nd his team to compare the two approaches to \\nsegmenting the Chinese market, seeking points of overlap and distinction. Exhibit 9  shows what \\npercentage of each Compass segment is represented within the CLUES segments. Exhibit 10  \\nshows what percentage of each CLUES segment  is represented within the Compass segments. \\nA Plan for VAIO \\nWith the Shanghai Report, the interview data, Project Compass, and the CLUES study, Lopez \\nand his team had a wealth of information a bout Chinese consumer preferences for electronic \\nproducts and their perceptions of the Sony an d VAIO brands. He understood the potential value \\nof Project Compass, but was reluctant to abandon the findings of the CLUES study that his team had completed. \\nThe more he and his team members sifted thr ough the data, the more tradeoffs they perceived \\nbetween the segmentation models and the more un certain they became regarding which to use. \\nIntegrating the models by crossing the segmentati ons had yielded a richer picture of the Chinese \\nlaptop market, but it was unclear exactly how it c ould be applied to developing a successful plan. \\nKnowing that he had less than a week to comp lete the VAIO marketing plan, Lopez returned \\nto the reports and printouts on his desk. \\n \\n \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\USER\\\\Downloads\\\\CASE _1.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

The intruders overpowered the victim, binding him and his wife, Mrs. Kamla Lal, with ropes. They then proceeded to loot the house, taking cash, jewelry, and other valuable items.\\n\\n\\nDuring the course of the robbery, an altercation occurred between the defendant and Mr. Shyam Lal. The defendant, in a fit of rage, struck the victim multiple times with a blunt object, resulting in Mr. Lal's death. The assailants then fled the scene with the stolen property.\\n\\n\\nThe incident was reported by Mrs. Kamla Lal, who managed to untie herself and call the police. The police arrived promptly and initiated an investigation.
